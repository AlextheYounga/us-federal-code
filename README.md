# US Federal Code on Github
## The Entire US Federal Legal Code in Markdown Format

This project aims to make the United States legal code more accessible, transparent, and easier to analyze. By hosting the legal code on GitHub, changes can be tracked in a cleaner manner, enabling greater scrutiny and collaboration.

## Purpose

The primary goals of this repository are:

1. **Public Accessibility**: Provide the US legal code in an easily accessible and readable Markdown format.
2. **Change Tracking**: Use Git's version control to track changes to the legal code, making it clear when and how laws evolve over time.
3. **Scrutiny and Collaboration**: Facilitate public and academic scrutiny of the legal code, enabling meaningful discussions and improvements.
4. **Digestion by LLMs**: Markdown format is easier for Large Language Models (LLMs) to parse, analyze, and learn from, thereby supporting the development of AI tools for legal research and education.

## Repository Structure
- Each section of the US Legal Code is organized into folders and files based on its title and chapter.
- The first document under each folder is called the "frontmatter", which contains introductory information about that particular part, subpart, chapter, or subchapter.
- The lowest level document is a "section", denoted by a "ยง" symbol.

## Features

- **Readable Format**: Markdown format ensures a clean and readable presentation of the law.
- **Trackable Changes**: Git enables users to view and analyze changes over time.
- **Lightweight**: Pruned non-crucial text minimizes storage requirements while preserving the core content of the law.

## Script Used for Creation
The script used to convert the legal code into Markdown format and organize it within this repository is available in a [separate GitHub repository](https://github.com/AlextheYounga/lawlab): This script is open-source and can be reused or modified for similar projects.
