"(1) whether integrity management system requirements, or elements thereof, should be expanded beyond high-consequence areas; and

"(2) with respect to gas transmission pipeline facilities, whether applying integrity management program requirements, or elements thereof, to additional areas would mitigate the need for class location requirements.

"(b) Factors.—In conducting the evaluation under subsection (a), the Secretary shall consider, at a minimum, the following:

"(1) The continuing priority to enhance protections for public safety.

"(2) The continuing importance of reducing risk in high-consequence areas.

"(3) The incremental costs of applying integrity management standards to pipelines outside of high-consequence areas where operators are already conducting assessments beyond what is required under chapter 601 of title 49, United States Code.

"(4) The need to undertake integrity management assessments and repairs in a manner that is achievable and sustainable, and that does not disrupt pipeline service.

"(5) The options for phasing in the extension of integrity management requirements beyond high-consequence areas, including the most effective and efficient options for decreasing risks to an increasing number of people living or working in proximity to pipeline facilities.

"(6) The appropriateness of applying repair criteria, such as pressure reductions and special requirements for scheduling remediation, to areas that are not high-consequence areas.

"(c) Report.—Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act [Jan. 3, 2012], the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate a report, based on the evaluation conducted under subsection (a), containing the Secretary's analysis and findings regarding—

"(1) expansion of integrity management requirements, or elements thereof, beyond high-consequence areas; and

"(2) with respect to gas transmission pipeline facilities, whether applying the integrity management program requirements, or elements thereof, to additional areas would mitigate the need for class location requirements.

"(d) Data Reporting.—The Secretary shall collect any relevant data necessary to complete the evaluation required by subsection (a).

"(e) Technical Correction.—[Amended this section.]

"(f) Rulemaking Requirements.—

"(1) Review period defined.—In this subsection, the term 'review period' means the period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act [Jan. 3, 2012] and ending on the earlier of—

"(A) the date that is 1 year after the date of completion of the report under subsection (c); or

"(B) the date that is 3 years after the date of enactment of this Act.

"(2) Congressional authority.—In order to provide Congress the necessary time to review the results of the report required by subsection (c) and implement appropriate recommendations, the Secretary shall not, during the review period, issue final regulations described in paragraph (3)(B).

"(3) Standards.—

"(A) Findings.—As soon as practicable following the review period, the Secretary shall issue final regulations described in subparagraph (B), if the Secretary finds, in the report required under subsection (c), that—

"(i) integrity management system requirements, or elements thereof, should be expanded beyond high-consequence areas; and
