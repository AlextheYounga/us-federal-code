#### **Editorial Notes** ####

#### Amendments ####

**2024**—Pub. L. 118–63 substituted "individuals involved in accidents and families of such individuals" for "for families of individuals involved in accidents" in section catchline and "individuals involved in accidents and the families of such individuals" for "the families of individuals involved in the accident" in introductory provisions in text.

[<sup>1</sup> So in original. Probably should be followed by "for".](#1140_1)
