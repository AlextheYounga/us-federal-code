In subsection (a), the words "As part of his annual report each year" in 45:792 are omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement of the source provisions.

In subsection (b), before clause (1), the words "aviation activities of the Department" are substituted for "work performed under this chapter" because of the restatement. The words "The report shall include" are substituted for "Such report shall contain" for consistency. In clause (1), the words "and data" after "information" are omitted as surplus. The words "airspace of the United States" are substituted for "National airspace" for clarity and consistency. In clause (2), the words "the Secretary considers necessary" are substituted for "as may be considered" for clarity.

This [deletion of the last sentence of subsection (a)] is necessary because section 111(b) of the Congressional Reports Elimination Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97–375, 96 Stat. 1821) repealed section 602 of the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 93–236, 87 Stat. 1022), which was restated as section 308(a) (last sentence) of title 49 by section 1 of the Act of January 12, 1983 (Pub. L. 97–449, 96 Stat. 2413).

In subsection (e)(1), the words "January of each even-numbered year" are substituted for "January of 1984 and in January of every second year thereafter" to eliminate unnecessary words.
