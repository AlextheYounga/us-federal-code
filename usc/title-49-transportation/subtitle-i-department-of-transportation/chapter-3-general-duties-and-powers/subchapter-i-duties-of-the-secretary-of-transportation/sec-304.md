In subsection (a), the text of 49:1653(g) (last sentence) is omitted as executed.

In subsection (a)(4), the word "ensure" is substituted for "assure" as being more precise. The words "of the United States Government" are substituted for "Federal", and the words "United States" are substituted for "national", for clarity and consistency.

In subsection (b), the words "The Secretaries shall report on April 1 of each year" are substituted for "They shall, within one year after the effective date of the Act, and annually thereafter, report" to omit executed words and to specify the date of April 1 because the President prescribed April 1, 1967, as the effective date of the Department of Transportation Act (Pub. L. 89–670, 80 Stat. 931) by Executive Order No. 11340, March 30, 1967 (32 F.R. 5443). The word "consider" is substituted for "determine" for consistency.
