In subsection (a), the words "may make contracts" are substituted for "is authorized to enter into contracts" to eliminate unnecessary words. The words "the conduct of" before "scientific" are omitted as surplus. The words "a problem" are substituted for "any aspect of the problems" because of the style of the revised title.

The words "is able to carry out the contract" are substituted for "have the capability of doing effective work" for clarity.
