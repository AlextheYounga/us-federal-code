In subsection (e)(6)(C), the words "Part A of title I of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (Public Law 102–240, 105 Stat. 1915)" are substituted for "the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1991" because the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1991 was title I of H.R. 1531, that was not enacted into law but contained predecessor provisions to Part A of title I of H.R. 2950, enacted into law as the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991.

In subsection (f)(1), the words "or entity" are omitted as surplus.
