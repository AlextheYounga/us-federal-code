(1) identifies each main track location where there is a reduction of more than 20 miles per hour from the approach speed to a curve, bridge, or tunnel and the maximum authorized operating speed for passenger trains at that curve, bridge, or tunnel;

(2) describes appropriate actions to enable warning and enforcement of the maximum authorized speed for passenger trains at each location identified under paragraph (1), including—

(A) modification to automatic train control systems, if applicable, or other signal systems;

(B) increased crew size;

(C) installation of signage alerting train crews of the maximum authorized speed for passenger trains in each location identified under paragraph (1);

(F) other practices;

(3) contains milestones and target dates for implementing each appropriate action described under paragraph (2); and

(d) Periodic Reviews and Updates.—Each railroad carrier that submits an action plan to the Secretary pursuant to subsection (b) shall—

(1) not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of the Passenger Rail Expansion and Rail Safety Act of 2021, and annually thereafter, review such plan to ensure the effectiveness of actions taken to enable warning and enforcement of the maximum authorized speed for passenger trains at each location identified pursuant to subsection (b)(1); and

(2) not later than 90 days before implementing any significant operational or territorial operating change, including initiating a new service or route, submit to the Secretary a revised action plan, after consultation with any applicable host railroad, that addresses such operational or territorial operating change.

(e) New Service.—If a railroad carrier providing intercity rail passenger transportation or commuter rail passenger transportation did not exist on the date of enactment of the FAST Act (Public Law 114–94; 129 Stat. 1312), such railroad carrier, in consultation with any applicable host railroad carrier, shall—

(1) survey its routes pursuant to subsection (a) not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of the Passenger Rail Expansion and Rail Safety Act of 2021; and

(2) develop an action plan pursuant to subsection (b) not later than 120 days after the date on which such survey is complete.
