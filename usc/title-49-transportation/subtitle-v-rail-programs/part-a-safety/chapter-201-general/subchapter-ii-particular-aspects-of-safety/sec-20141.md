### §20141. Power brake safety ###

(a) Review and Revision of Existing Regulations.—The Secretary of Transportation shall review existing regulations on railroad power brakes and, not later than December 31, 1993, revise the regulations based on safety information presented during the review. Where applicable, the Secretary shall prescribe regulations that establish standards on dynamic braking equipment.

(b) 2-Way End-of-Train Devices.—(1) The Secretary shall require 2-way end-of-train devices (or devices able to perform the same function) on road trains, except locals, road switchers, or work trains, to enable the initiation of emergency braking from the rear of a train. The Secretary shall prescribe regulations as soon as possible, but not later than December 31, 1993, requiring the 2-way end-of-train devices. The regulations at least shall—

(A) establish standards for the devices based on performance;

(B) prohibit a railroad carrier, on or after the date that is one year after the regulations are prescribed, from acquiring any end-of-train device for use on trains that is not a 2-way device meeting the standards established under clause (A) of this paragraph;

(C) require that the trains be equipped with 2-way end-of-train devices meeting those standards not later than 4 years after the regulations are prescribed; and

(D) provide that any 2-way end-of-train device acquired for use on trains before the regulations are prescribed shall be deemed to meet the standards.

(2) The Secretary may consider petitions to amend the regulations prescribed under paragraph (1) of this subsection to allow the use of alternative technologies that meet the same basic performance requirements established by the regulations.

(3) In developing the regulations required by paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary shall consider information presented under subsection (a) of this section.

(c) Exclusions.—The Secretary may exclude from regulations prescribed under subsections (a) and (b) of this section any category of trains or rail operations if the Secretary decides that the exclusion is in the public interest and is consistent with railroad safety. The Secretary shall make public the reasons for the exclusion. The Secretary at least shall exclude from the regulations prescribed under subsection (b)—

(1) trains that have manned cabooses;

(2) passenger trains with emergency brakes;

(3) trains that operate only on track that is not part of the general railroad system;

(4) trains that do not exceed 30 miles an hour and do not operate on heavy grades, except for any categories of trains specifically designated by the Secretary; and

(5) trains that operate in a push mode.

"(a) Government Accountability Office Study.—

"(1) In general.—The Comptroller General of the United States shall conduct an independent evaluation of ECP brake systems, pilot program data, and the Department [of Transportation]'s research and analysis on the costs, benefits, and effects of ECP brake systems.

"(2) Study elements.—In completing the independent evaluation under paragraph (1), the Comptroller General shall examine the following issues related to ECP brake systems:

"(A) Data and modeling results on safety benefits relative to conventional brakes and to other braking technologies or systems, such as distributed power and 2-way end-of-train devices.

"(B) Data and modeling results on business benefits, including the effects of dynamic braking.

"(C) Data on costs, including up-front capital costs and on-going maintenance costs.

"(D) Analysis of potential operational benefits and challenges, including the effects of potential locomotive and car segregation, technical reliability issues, and network disruptions.

"(E) Analysis of potential implementation challenges, including installation time, positive train control integration complexities, component availability issues, and tank car shop capabilities.

"(F) Analysis of international experiences with the use of advanced braking technologies.

"(3) Report.—Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act [Dec. 4, 2015], the Comptroller General shall transmit to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate a report on the results of the independent evaluation under paragraph (1).

"(b) Emergency Braking Application Testing.—

"(1) In general.—The Secretary [of Transportation] shall enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences to—

"(A) complete testing of ECP brake systems during emergency braking application, including more than 1 scenario involving the uncoupling of a train with 70 or more DOT–117 specification or DOT–117R specification tank cars; and

"(B) transmit, not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act, to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate a report on the results of the testing.

"(2) Determination.—Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall—

"(A) determine, based on whether the final regulatory impact analysis described in paragraph (1)(C) demonstrates that the benefits, including safety benefits, of the applicable ECP brake system requirements exceed the costs of such requirements, whether the applicable ECP brake system requirements are justified;

"(B) if the applicable ECP brake system requirements are justified, publish in the Federal Register the determination and reasons for such determination; and

"(C) if the Secretary does not publish the determination under subparagraph (B), repeal the applicable ECP brake system requirements.

"(3) Savings clause.—Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the Secretary from implementing the final rule described under subsection (b)(2)(A) prior to the determination required under subsection (c)(2) of this section, or require the Secretary to promulgate a new rule on the provisions of such final rule, other than on the applicable ECP brake system requirements, if the Secretary does not determine that the applicable ECP brake system requirements are justified pursuant to this subsection.
