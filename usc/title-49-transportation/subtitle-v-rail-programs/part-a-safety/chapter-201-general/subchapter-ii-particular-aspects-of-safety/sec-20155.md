### §20155. Tank cars ###

(a) Standards.—The Federal Railroad Administration shall—

(1) validate a predictive model to quantify the relevant dynamic forces acting on railroad tank cars under accident conditions within 1 year after the date of enactment of this section; and

(2) initiate a rulemaking to develop and implement appropriate design standards for pressurized tank cars within 18 months after the date of enactment of this section.

(b) Older Tank Car Impact Resistance Analysis and Report.—Within 1 year after the date of enactment of this section the Federal Railroad Administration shall conduct a comprehensive analysis to determine the impact resistance of the steels in the shells of pressure tank cars constructed before 1989. Within 6 months after completing that analysis the Administration shall transmit a report, including recommendations for reducing any risk of catastrophic fracture and separation of such cars, to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives.

"(4) For transport of Class 3 flammable liquids in Packing Groups II and III, other than Class 3 flammable liquids specified in paragraphs (1) and (2), May 1, 2029.

"(c) Retrofitting Shop Capacity.—The Secretary [of Transportation] may extend the deadlines established under paragraphs (3) and (4) of subsection (b) for a period not to exceed 2 years if the Secretary determines that insufficient retrofitting shop capacity will prevent the phase-out of tank cars not meeting the DOT–117, DOT–117P, or DOT–117R specifications by the deadlines set forth in such paragraphs.

"(d) Conforming Regulatory Amendments.—

"(1) In general.—Immediately after the date of enactment of this section [Dec. 4, 2015], the Secretary—

"(A) shall remove or revise the date-specific deadlines in any applicable regulations or orders to the extent necessary to conform with the requirements of this section; and

"(e) Savings Clause.—Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the Secretary from implementing the final rule issued on May 08, 2015, entitled 'Enhanced Tank Car Standards and Operational Controls for High-Hazard Flammable Trains' (80 Fed. Reg. 26643), other than the provisions of the final rule that are inconsistent with this section.

"(f) Class 3 Flammable Liquid Defined.—In this section, the term 'Class 3 flammable liquid' has the meaning given the term flammable liquid in section 173.120(a) of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations."
