### §47143. Non-movement area surveillance surface display systems pilot program ###

(a) In General.—The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration may carry out a pilot program to support non-Federal acquisition and installation of qualifying non-movement area surveillance surface display systems and sensors if—

(1) the Administrator determines that such systems and sensors would improve safety or capacity in the National Airspace System; and

(2) the non-movement area surveillance surface display systems and sensors supplement existing movement area systems and sensors at the selected airports established under other programs administered by the Administrator.

(d) Definitions.—In this section:

(1) Non-movement area.—The term "non-movement area" means the portion of the airfield surface that is not under the control of air traffic control.

(2) Non-movement area surveillance surface display systems and sensors.—The term "non-movement area surveillance surface display systems and sensors" means a non-Federal surveillance system that uses on-airport sensors that track vehicles or aircraft that are equipped with transponders in the non-movement area.

(3) Qualifying non-movement area surveillance surface display system and sensors.—The term "qualifying non-movement area surveillance surface display system and sensors" means a non-movement area surveillance surface display system that—

(A) provides the required transmit and receive data formats consistent with the National Airspace System architecture at the appropriate service delivery point;

(B) is on-airport; and

(C) is airport operated.
