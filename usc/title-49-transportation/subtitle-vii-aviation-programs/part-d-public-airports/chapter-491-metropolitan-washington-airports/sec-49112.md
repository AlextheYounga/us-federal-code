### §49112. Separability and effect of judicial order ###

(a) Separability.—If any provision of this chapter, or the application of a provision of this chapter to a person or circumstance, is held invalid, the remainder of this chapter and the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected.

(b) Effect of Judicial Order.—Any action of the Airports Authority that was required to be submitted to the Board of Review under section 6007(f)(4) of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Act of 1986 (Public Law 99–500; 100 Stat. 1783–380; Public Law 99–599; 100 Stat. 3341–383) before October 9, 1996, remains in effect and may not be set aside only because of a judicial order invalidating certain functions of the Board.

Section 6007(f)(4) of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Act of 1986, referred to in subsec. (b), is section 6007(f)(4) of Pub. L. 99–500, title VI, Oct. 18, 1986, 100 Stat. 1783–379, and Pub. L. 99–591, title VI, Oct. 30, 1986, 100 Stat. 3341–382, which related to a Board of Review and was classified to section 2456(f)(4) of former Title 49, Transportation. Subsec. (f) of section 6007 was repealed and subsec. (g) redesignated (f) by Pub. L. 104–264, title IX, §904(a), Oct. 9, 1996, 110 Stat. 3276. Section 6007 was subsequently repealed and reenacted as section 49106 of Title 49, Transportation, by Pub. L. 105–102, §§2(26), 5(b), Nov. 20, 1997, 111 Stat. 2205, 2217, and does not contain provisions relating to a Board of Review.
