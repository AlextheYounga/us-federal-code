(a) Assessment.—

(1) In general.—On a regular basis, the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of State, shall assess aviation safety oversight measures carried out by any foreign country—

(A) from which a foreign air carrier is conducting foreign air transportation to and from the United States;

(B) from which a foreign air carrier seeks to conduct foreign air transportation to and from the United States;

(C) whose air carriers carry or seek to carry the code of a United States air carrier; or

(D) as determined appropriate by the Administrator.

(2) Consultation and criteria.—In conducting an assessment described in paragraph (1), the Administrator shall—

(A) consult with the appropriate authorities of the government of the foreign country;

(i) the Convention on International Civil Aviation (in this section referred to as the "Chicago Convention");

(ii) international aviation safety standards; and

(iii) recommended practices set forth by the International Civil Aviation Organization;

(C) use a standard approach and methodology that will result in an analysis of the aviation safety oversight activities of such foreign country that are carried out to meet the minimum standards contained in Annexes 1, 6, and 8 to the Chicago Convention in effect on the date of the assessment, or any such successor documents; and

(D) identify instances of noncompliance pertaining to the aviation safety oversight activities of such foreign country consistent with the Chicago Convention, international aviation safety standards, and recommended practices set forth by the International Civil Aviation Organization.

(3) Findings of noncompliance.—In any case in which the assessment described in subsection (a)(1) finds an instance of non-compliance, the Administrator shall—

(A) notify the foreign country that is the subject of such finding;

(B) not later than 90 days after transmission of such notification, request and initiate final discussions with the foreign country to recommend actions by which the foreign country can mitigate the noncompliance; and

(C) after the discussions described in subparagraph (B) have concluded, determine whether or not the noncompliance finding has been corrected;

(b) Uncorrected Non-compliance.—If the Administrator finds that such foreign country has not corrected the non-compliance by the close of such final discussions—

(1) the Administrator shall notify the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of State that the condition of noncompliance remains;

(2) the Administrator, after consulting with informing the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of State, shall notify the foreign country of such finding; and

(3) notwithstanding section 40105(b), the Administrator, after consulting with the appropriate civil aviation authority of such foreign country and notifying the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of State, may withhold, revoke, or prescribe conditions on the operating authority of a foreign air carrier that—

(A) provides or seeks to provide foreign air transportation to and from the United States; or

(B) carries or seeks to carry the code of an air carrier.

(c) Authority.—Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b), the Administrator retains the ability to take immediate safety oversight actions if the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of State, as needed, determines that a condition exists that threatens the safety of passengers, aircraft, or crew traveling to or from such foreign country. In this event that the Administrator makes a determination under this subsection, the Administrator shall immediately notify the Secretary of State of such determination so that the Secretary of State may issue a travel advisory with respect to such foreign country.
