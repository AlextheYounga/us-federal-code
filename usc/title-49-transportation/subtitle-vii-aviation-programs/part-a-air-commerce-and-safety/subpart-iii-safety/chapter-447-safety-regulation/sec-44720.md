### §44720. Meteorological services ###

(a) Recommendations.—The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall make recommendations to the Secretary of Commerce on providing meteorological services necessary for the safe and efficient movement of aircraft in air commerce. In providing the services, the Secretary shall cooperate with the Administrator and give complete consideration to those recommendations.

(b) Promoting Safety and Efficiency.—To promote safety and efficiency in air navigation to the highest possible degree, the Secretary shall—

(1) observe, measure, investigate, and study atmospheric phenomena, and maintain meteorological stations and offices, that are necessary or best suited for finding out in advance information about probable weather conditions;

(2) provide reports to the Administrator, to persons engaged in civil aeronautics that are designated by the the Administrator, and to other persons designated by the Secretary in a way and with a frequency that best will result in safety in, and facilitating, air navigation;

(3) cooperate with persons engaged in air commerce in meteorological services, maintain reciprocal arrangements with those persons in carrying out this clause, and collect and distribute weather reports available from aircraft in flight;

(4) maintain and coordinate international exchanges of meteorological information required for the safety and efficiency of air navigation;

(5) in cooperation with other departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the United States Government, meteorological services of foreign countries, and persons engaged in air commerce, participate in developing an international basic meteorological reporting network, including the establishment, operation, and maintenance of reporting stations on the high seas, in polar regions, and in foreign countries;

(6) coordinate meteorological requirements in the United States to maintain standard observations, to promote efficient use of facilities, and to avoid duplication of services unless the duplication tends to promote the safety and efficiency of air navigation; and

(7) promote and develop meteorological science and foster and support research projects in meteorology through the use of private and governmental research facilities and provide for publishing the results of the projects unless publication would not be in the public interest.

In subsection (b), the title "Secretary" [of Commerce] is substituted for "Chief of the Weather Bureau" in section 803 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (Public Law 85–726, 72 Stat. 783) because of sections 1 and 2 of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1965 (eff. July 13, 1965, 79 Stat. 1318). Before clause (1), the words "In order" and "in addition to any other functions or duties pertaining to weather information for other purposes" are omitted as surplus. In clause (2), the words "forecasts, warnings, and advices" are omitted as being included in "reports". In clause (3), the words "or employees thereof" and "establish and" are omitted as surplus. The words "with those persons" are added for clarity. In clause (5), the words "departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the United States Government" are substituted for "governmental agencies of the United States" for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.
