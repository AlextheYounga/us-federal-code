### §101. Establishment of Coast Guard ###

The Coast Guard, established January 28, 1915, shall be a military service and a branch of the armed forces of the United States at all times.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 496, §1; Pub. L. 94–546, §1(1), Oct. 18, 1976, 90 Stat. 2519; Pub. L. 107–296, title XVII, §1704(a), Nov. 25, 2002, 116 Stat. 2314; Pub. L. 112–213, title II, §217(1), Dec. 20, 2012, 126 Stat. 1555; renumbered §101, Pub. L. 115–282, title I, §103(b), Dec. 4, 2018, 132 Stat. 4195.)

#### Historical and Revision Notes ####

Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §1 (Jan. 28, 1915, ch. 20, §1, 38 Stat. 800; July 11, 1941, ch. 290, §§5, 6(a), 55 Stat. 585).

Said section has been divided. Provisions relating to operation under the Navy in time of war are placed in sections 3 and 4 of this title, and the remainder is in this section.

This section continues the Coast Guard as a military service and branch of the armed forces of the United States at all times. By the act of July 11, 1941, 55 Stat. 585 (title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §1), the Coast Guard was constituted a branch of the land and naval forces of the United States at all times. This section therefore merely continues an existing agency and codifies existing law on the military status of the Coast Guard, substituting "armed forces" for "land and naval forces" because of the recent establishment of the Department of the Air Force as an "armed force" rather than as a part of the "land and naval forces". The Coast Guard is designated a service in the Treasury Department except when operating as a service in the Navy. This is a better definition of the status of the Coast Guard than one which defines it as a service under the Treasury Department in time of peace, because the President is authorized to place the Coast Guard under the Navy in time of emergency, which could be in time of peace.

Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.
