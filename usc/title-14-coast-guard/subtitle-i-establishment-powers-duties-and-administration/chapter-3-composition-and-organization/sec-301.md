#### Historical and Revision Notes ####

#### 1949 Act ####

Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§5, 9, 21 (Apr. 12, 1902, ch. 501, §1, 32 Stat. 100; Jan. 28, 1915, ch. 20, §2, 38 Stat. 801; May 18, 1920, ch. 190, §8, 41 Stat. 603; June 5, 1920, ch. 235, §1, 41 Stat. 879; Jan. 12, 1923, ch. 25, §§1, 2, 42 Stat. 1130; July 3, 1926, ch. 742, §§3, 9, 10, 44 Stat. 815, 817).

The grades of vice admiral and rear admiral are added to make provision for the commissioned officer personnel structure of the service as provided for in this revision. The entire rating structure for enlisted men is left to the administrative discretion of the Secretary, as in the past, for reasons of flexibility.

The last two paragraphs of said section 5 are obsolete and have been omitted.

Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.
