This section broadens existing law in that it authorizes the Coast Guard to engage in saving life and property in the broadest possible terms, without limitation as to place. This section reflects existing sentiment as to Coast Guard functions in relation to saving life and property. There is no intention to supersede or conflict with the present authority of the Civil Aeronautics Board to investigate certain aircraft wrecks. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.
