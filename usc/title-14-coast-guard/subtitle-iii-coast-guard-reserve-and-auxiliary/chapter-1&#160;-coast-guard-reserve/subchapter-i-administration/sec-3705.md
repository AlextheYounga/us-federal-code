### §3705. Benefits ###

(a) A member of the Reserve on active duty, on inactive-duty training, or engaged in authorized travel to or from that duty, is entitled to the same benefits as a member of the Navy Reserve of corresponding grade, rating, and length of service. In determining length of service for the purpose of this section, there shall be included all service for which credit is given by law to members of the Regular Coast Guard.

(b) Chapter 27 of this title applies to a member of the Reserve under the same conditions and limitations as it applies to a member of the Regular Coast Guard.

(c) A member of the Reserve who suffers sickness, disease, disability, or death is entitled to the same benefits as prescribed by law for a member of the Navy Reserve who suffers sickness, disease, disability, or death under similar conditions.

(d) A member of the Reserve on active duty or when retired for disability is entitled to the benefits of section 253(a) of title 42. A member of the Reserve when on active duty (other than for training) or when retired for disability is entitled to the benefits of chapter 55 of title 10.

(e) A member of the Reserve, except an enlisted member retiring on the basis of years of active service, is entitled to the same retirement rights, benefits, and privileges as prescribed by law for a member of the Navy Reserve, and wherever a law confers authority upon the Secretary of the Navy, similar authority is given to the Secretary to be exercised with respect to the Coast Guard when the Coast Guard is not operating as a service in the Navy. An enlisted member of the Reserve who retires on the basis of years of active service is entitled to the same retirement rights, benefits, and privileges as prescribed by law for an enlisted member of the Regular Coast Guard.

(f) A member of the Coast Guard Reserve not on active duty who is enrolled in an officer candidate program authorized by section 12209 of title 10 leading to a commission in the Coast Guard Reserve, and is a full-time student in an accredited college curriculum leading to a bachelor's degree may be paid a subsistence allowance for each month of the member's academic year at the same rate as that prescribed by section 209(a) of title 37.
