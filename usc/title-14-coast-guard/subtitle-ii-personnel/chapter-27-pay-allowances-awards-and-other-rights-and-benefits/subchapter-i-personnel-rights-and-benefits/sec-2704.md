(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 532, §477; renumbered §2704, Pub. L. 115–282, title I, §116(b), Dec. 4, 2018, 132 Stat. 4226.)

#### Historical and Revision Notes ####

Derived from title 5, U.S.C., 1946, ed., §118g (Aug. 2, 1946, ch. 744, §13, 60 Stat. 809).

Because of the wide variety of tasks assigned to Coast Guard personnel it is deemed advisable to broaden this authority to the more general language as rewritten, insofar as Coast Guard personnel are concerned, thus giving complete authority to protect their health.

Said section would in no way be affected.

Inasmuch as the act cited above applies to executive departments generally, it is not scheduled for repeal by this act. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.
