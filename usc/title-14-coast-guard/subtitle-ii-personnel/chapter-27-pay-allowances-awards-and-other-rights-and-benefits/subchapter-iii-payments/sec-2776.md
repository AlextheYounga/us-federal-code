(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 533, §481; Pub. L. 98–557, §15(a)(3)(C), Oct. 30, 1984, 98 Stat. 2865; renumbered §2776, Pub. L. 115–282, title I, §116(b), Dec. 4, 2018, 132 Stat. 4226.)

#### Historical and Revision Notes ####

Derived from title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §197, and title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §3a (Mar. 4, 1925, ch. 536, §10, 43 Stat. 1274; Oct. 26, 1942, ch. 623, 56 Stat. 987).

Said section 197 was made applicable to the Coast Guard by title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §3a whenever the Coast Guard is operating with the Navy. Experience has shown the advantage of having such a provision applicable to the Coast Guard at all times.

Said section would in no way be affected. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.
