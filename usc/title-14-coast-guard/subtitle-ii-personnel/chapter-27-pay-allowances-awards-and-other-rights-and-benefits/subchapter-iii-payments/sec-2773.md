#### Historical and Revision Notes ####

Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§134, 135 (Mar. 25, 1940, ch. 71, title I, 54 Stat. 64; June 6, 1940, ch. 257, §10, 54 Stat. 248; May 31, 1941, ch. 156, title I, §1, 55 Stat. 221; Feb. 7, 1942, ch. 46, title I, 56 Stat. 71; June 26, 1943, ch. 147, §1, 57 Stat. 211; June 22, 1944, ch. 269, §1, 58 Stat. 316; May 29, 1945, ch. 130, §1, 59 Stat. 216; July 12, 1946, ch. 569, §1, 60 Stat. 531; Aug. 2, 1946, ch. 756, §31, 60 Stat. 857; July 1, 1947, ch. 186, title I, §101, 61 Stat. 226).

The provisions of said section 134 are extended to include all persons who might be entitled to receive money for commuted rations, rather than only the officer in charge of the mess.

The last proviso of said section 135 is eliminated, because experience during the past 2 years shows that it may react detrimentally on enlisted men in time of rising food costs.

Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.
