### §2502. Retirement ###

(a) Every commissioned officer, warrant officer, or enlisted member who is retired under any provisions of this title shall be retired with the permanent grade or rate held at the time of retirement, unless entitled to retire with a higher grade or rate under any provision of this title or any other law.

#### Historical and Revision Notes ####

Subsection (a) is new in this form, but the provision contained therein is expressed or implied in numerous statutes relating to the retirement of military personnel.

A provision defining the next higher grade to that of commissioned warrant officer as lieutenant (junior grade), for purposes of retirement, was added.

The other provisions of said section are obsolete and are no longer needed.

Subsection (a) is new, but the provision contained in it is expressed or implied in numerous statutes relating to retirement of military personnel. It is believed desirable to include such a provision to prevent any misconstruction of retirement statutes, even though no change in existing law is intended on the point covered, either by other sections dealing with retirement or by this section.

Subsection (b) is a codification of the only provision of title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §174, that it is desired to retain, and in addition designated the next higher grade for commissioned warrant officers as lieutenant (junior grade) because the pay of the commissioned warrant officers is the same as for the grade of lieutenant (junior grade) and advancing such officers to the grade of ensign would in some aspects not appear to be a promotion. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.
