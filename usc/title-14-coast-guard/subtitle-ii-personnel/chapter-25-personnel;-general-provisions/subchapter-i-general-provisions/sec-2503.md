### §2503. Status of recalled personnel ###

All retired personnel when recalled to active duty shall serve in the grade or rate in which they were serving at the time of retirement.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 524, §422; Pub. L. 99–348, title II, §205(b)(10), July 1, 1986, 100 Stat. 700; renumbered §2503, Pub. L. 115–282, title I, §114(b), Dec. 4, 2018, 132 Stat. 4223.)

#### Historical and Revision Notes ####

This provision is desirable because many enlisted men and low-ranking officers may now retire with higher grade which they previously held on a temporary basis. If recalled in the higher grades, they might not be capable of holding same at the time of recall. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.
