#### Amendments ####

**2018**—Pub. L. 115–282 renumbered section 292 of this title as this section.

**1986**—Pub. L. 99–348 which directed that ", with retired pay of the grade with which retired" be struck out was executed by striking out that phrase after "from active service" as the probable intent of Congress even though there was no comma before "with retired".

#### Retired Pay on or Prior to September 24, 1963 ####

Savings provisions in section 5(g) of Pub. L. 88–130, providing that Pub. L. 88–130 does not affect the retired pay of anyone retired on or prior to Sept. 24, 1963, are set out as a note under section 2101 of this title.
