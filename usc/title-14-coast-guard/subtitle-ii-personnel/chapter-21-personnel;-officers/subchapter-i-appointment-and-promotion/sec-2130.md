(c) Preservation of Position and Status of Officers Appointed.—

(1) The temporary positions authorized under this section shall not be counted among or included in the list of positions on the active duty promotion list.

(f) Termination of Appointment.—Unless sooner terminated, an appointment under this section terminates—

(1) on the date the officer who received the appointment is promoted to the permanent grade of lieutenant, lieutenant commander, commander, or captain;
