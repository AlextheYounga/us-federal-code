(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 522, §359; Aug. 3, 1950, ch. 536, §18, 64 Stat. 407; Pub. L. 98–557, §15(a)(3)(A), Oct. 30, 1984, 98 Stat. 2865; renumbered §2308, Pub. L. 115–282, title I, §113(b), Dec. 4, 2018, 132 Stat. 4221.)

#### Historical and Revision Notes ####

Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §185c (May 24, 1939, ch. 146, §4, 53 Stat. 755).

This section was changed so as to make provisions for enlisted men parallel to similar provisions for commissioned and warrant officers (see §§240 and 310 of the revised title). It seems fair and equitable that similar provisions should apply to all classes of personnel insofar as practicable. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

#### Amendments ####

**2018**—Pub. L. 115–282 renumbered section 359 of this title as this section.

**1984**—Pub. L. 98–557 substituted reference to enlisted member for reference to enlisted man.

**1950**—Act Aug. 3, 1950, struck out all references to pay.
