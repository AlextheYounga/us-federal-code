#### Amendments ####

**2018**—Pub. L. 115–282, §123(b)(2), which directed amendment of this title by striking each reference to a section redesignated by title I of Pub. L. 115–282 and inserting a reference to the redesignated section, was executed by substituting "sections 2312 to 2314" for "sections 365 to 368" to reflect the probable intent of Congress. Sections 365 to 367 of this title were redesignated as sections 2312 to 2314 of this title by title I of Pub. L. 115–282, whereas section 368 of this title had previously been repealed by Pub. L. 97–322, title I, §115(b)(1), Oct. 15, 1982, 96 Stat. 1585.

Pub. L. 115–282, §113(b), renumbered section 369 of this title as this section.
