Nothing in this chapter may be construed to require a depository institution to use any such model form or clause prescribed by the Bureau under this subsection.

#### **Editorial Notes** ####

#### References in Text ####

Section 4311(b) of this title, referred to in subsec. (a)(4), was in the original "section 12(b)", probably meaning section 12(b) of Pub. L. 102–242, and was translated as meaning section 272(b) of Pub. L. 102–242, to reflect the probable intent of Congress. There is no section 12 of Pub. L. 102–242, and section 272(b) of Pub. L. 102–242 relates to regulations prescribed by the National Credit Union Administration Board.

#### Amendments ####

**1992**—Pub. L. 102–550, §1604(e)(2)(D)–(H), made technical amendment to references to "this chapter" wherever appearing to reflect correction of corresponding provision of original act.
