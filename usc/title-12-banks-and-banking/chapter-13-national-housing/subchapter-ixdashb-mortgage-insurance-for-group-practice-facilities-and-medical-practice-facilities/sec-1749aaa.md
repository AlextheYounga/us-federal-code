(4) bear interest at such rate as may be agreed upon by the mortgagor and the mortgagee.

[]()

#### (d) Conclusiveness of insurance contract as to eligibility; validity of contract incontestable ####

Any contract of insurance executed by the Secretary under this subchapter shall be conclusive evidence of the eligibility of the mortgage for insurance, and the validity of any contract for insurance so executed shall be incontestable in the hands of an approved mortgagee from the date of the execution of such contract, except for fraud or misrepresentation on the part of such approved mortgagee.

[]()

#### (e) Undertaking ####

Each mortgage insured under this subchapter shall contain an undertaking (in accordance with regulations prescribed under this subchapter and in force at the time the mortgage is approved for insurance) to the effect that, except as authorized by the Secretary and the mortgagee, the property will be used as a group practice facility or medical practice facility until the mortgage has been paid in full or the contract of insurance otherwise terminated.

#### (f) Recordkeeping; reports; examination and audit ####

No mortgage shall be insured under this subchapter unless the mortgagor and the mortgagee certify (1) that they will keep such records relating to the mortgage transaction and indebtedness, to the construction of the facility covered by the mortgage, and to the use of such facility as a group practice facility or medical practice facility as are prescribed by the Secretary at the time of such certification, (2) that they will make such reports as may from time to time be required by the Secretary pertaining to such matters, and (3) that the Secretary shall have access to and the right to examine and audit such records.
