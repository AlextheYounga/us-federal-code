Title I of the Farm Credit Act of 1971, comprising this subchapter, was originally enacted by Pub. L. 92–181, title I, Dec. 10, 1971, 85 Stat. 583, and amended by Pub. L. 96–592, Dec. 24, 1980, 94 Stat. 3437; Pub. L. 99–205, Dec. 23, 1985, 99 Stat. 1678; Pub. L. 99–509, Oct. 21, 1986, 100 Stat. 1874; Pub. L. 100–233, Jan. 6, 1988, 101 Stat. 1568. Such title is shown herein, however, as having been added by Pub. L. 100–233, title IV, §401, Jan. 6, 1988, 101 Stat. 1622, without reference to such intervening amendments because of the extensive revision of the title's provisions by Pub. L. 100–233.
