#### (5) Non-IBOR loan ####

The term "non-IBOR loan" means any loan that, by its terms, does not use in any way LIBOR, any tenor of non-U.S. dollar currency rates formerly known as the London interbank offered rate as administered by ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (or any predecessor or successor administrator thereof), and any other interbank offered rates that are expected to cease, as a benchmark.

#### (b) Benchmarks used by banks ####

With respect to a benchmark used by a bank—

(1) the bank, in any non-IBOR loan made before, on, or after March 15, 2022, may use any benchmark, including a benchmark that is not SOFR, that the bank determines to be appropriate for the funding model of the bank; the needs of the customers of the bank; and the products, risk profile, risk management capabilities, and operational capabilities of the bank; provided, however, that the use of any benchmark shall remain subject to the terms of the non-IBOR loan, and applicable law; and

(2) no Federal supervisory agency may take any covered action against the bank solely because that benchmark is not SOFR.
