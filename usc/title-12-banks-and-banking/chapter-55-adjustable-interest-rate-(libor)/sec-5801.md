### §5801. Findings and purpose ###

#### (a) Findings ####

Congress finds that—

(1) LIBOR is used as a benchmark rate in more than $200,000,000,000,000 worth of contracts worldwide;

(2) a significant number of existing contracts that reference LIBOR do not provide for the use of a clearly defined or practicable replacement benchmark rate when LIBOR is discontinued; and

(3) the cessation or nonrepresentativeness of LIBOR could result in disruptive litigation related to existing contracts that do not provide for the use of a clearly defined or practicable replacement benchmark rate.

#### (b) Purpose ####

It is the purpose of this chapter—

(1) to establish a clear and uniform process, on a nationwide basis, for replacing LIBOR in existing contracts the terms of which do not provide for the use of a clearly defined or practicable replacement benchmark rate, without affecting the ability of parties to use any appropriate benchmark rate in new contracts;

(2) to preclude litigation related to existing contracts the terms of which do not provide for the use of a clearly defined or practicable replacement benchmark rate;

(3) to allow existing contracts that reference LIBOR but provide for the use of a clearly defined and practicable replacement rate, to operate according to their terms; and

(4) to address LIBOR references in Federal law.
