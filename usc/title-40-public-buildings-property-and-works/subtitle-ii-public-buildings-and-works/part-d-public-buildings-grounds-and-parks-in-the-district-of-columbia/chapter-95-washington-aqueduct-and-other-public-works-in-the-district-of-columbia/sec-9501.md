In subsection (a)(2), the words "pursuant to law" are omitted as unnecessary. The words "Secretary of the Army" are substituted for "Department of War" [subsequently changed to "Department of the Army" because of section 205(a) of the National Security Act of 1947 (ch. 343, 61 Stat. 501)] because of 10:3013(a)(1).

In subsection (b), the word "additional" is substituted for "other than his regular pay as an officer of the Corps of Engineers" to eliminate unnecessary words. The words "of him" are omitted as unnecessary. The words "this chapter" are substituted for "title 21 of the Revised Statutes" because the only provisions of title 21 related to the Chief of Engineers that have not been repealed are contained in the revised chapter.

In subsection (c), the words "an office" are substituted for "official apartments" for clarity. The words "District of Columbia" are substituted for "city of Washington" for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words "Administrator of General Services" are substituted for "President" [subsequently changed to "Public Buildings Commission" because of section 10 of the Act of March 1, 1919 (ch. 86, 40 Stat. 1269), "National Park Service" because of section 2 of Executive Order No. 6166 (eff. June 10, 1933) and the Act of March 2, 1934 (ch. 38, 48 Stat. 389), and "Public Buildings Administrator in the Federal Works Agency" because of sections 301 and 303 of Reorganization Plan No. I of 1939 (eff. July 1, 1939, 53 Stat. 1426, 1427)] because of section 103(a) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (ch. 288, 63 Stat. 380), which is restated as section 303(c) [303(b)] of the revised title.
