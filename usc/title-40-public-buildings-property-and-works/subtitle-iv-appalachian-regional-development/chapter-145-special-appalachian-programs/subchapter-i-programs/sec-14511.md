### §14511. Appalachian regional energy hub initiative ###

(a) In General.—The Appalachian Regional Commission may provide technical assistance to, make grants to, enter into contracts with, or otherwise provide amounts to individuals or entities in the Appalachian region for projects and activities—

(1) to conduct research and analysis regarding the economic impact of an ethane storage hub in the Appalachian region that supports a more-effective energy market performance due to the scale of the project, such as a project with the capacity to store and distribute more than 100,000 barrels per day of hydrocarbon feedstock with a minimum gross heating value of 1,700 Btu per standard cubic foot;

(2) with the potential to significantly contribute to the economic resilience of the area in which the project is located; and

(3) that will help establish a regional energy hub in the Appalachian region for natural gas and natural gas liquids, including hydrogen produced from the steam methane reforming of natural gas feedstocks.

(b) Limitation on Available Amounts.—Of the cost of any project or activity eligible for a grant under this section—

(1) except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), not more than 50 percent may be provided from amounts made available to carry out this section;

(2) in the case of a project or activity to be carried out in a county for which a distressed county designation is in effect under section 14526, not more than 80 percent may be provided from amounts made available to carry out this section; and

(3) in the case of a project or activity to be carried out in a county for which an at-risk county designation is in effect under section 14526, not more than 70 percent may be provided from amounts made available to carry out this section.

(c) Sources of Assistance.—Subject to subsection (b), a grant provided under this section may be provided from amounts made available to carry out this section, in combination with amounts made available—

(1) under any other Federal program; or

(2) from any other source.

(d) Federal Share.—Notwithstanding any provision of law limiting the Federal share under any other Federal program, amounts made available to carry out this section may be used to increase that Federal share, as the Appalachian Regional Commission determines to be appropriate.
