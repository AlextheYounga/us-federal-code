#### Findings ####

Pub. L. 117–328, div. Z, §102, Dec. 29, 2022, 136 Stat. 5523, provided that: "Congress finds the following:

"(1) Access to computers and computer technology is indispensable for success in the 21st century. Millions of Americans do not regularly use a computer and research shows that substantial disparities remain in both internet use and the quality of access, with the digital divide concentrated among older, less educated, less affluent populations, especially veterans, low-income students, and senior citizens.

"(2) The COVID–19 pandemic has highlighted the gap between those with computer access and those without. Millions of students, their families, and workers from across the economy were unable to do schoolwork, work remotely from home, or connect to loved ones and their communities because of the digital divide.

"(3) Any Federal program that distributes surplus, repairable Federal computers or technology equipment would benefit from a partnership with a nonprofit organization whose mission is bridging the digital divide."
