(Pub. L. 113–287, §3, Dec. 19, 2014, 128 Stat. 3249; Pub. L. 113–291, div. B, title XXX, §3033(e), Dec. 19, 2014, 128 Stat. 3777.)

#### Amendment Not Shown in Text ####

This section was derived from section 469n(f) of Title 16, Conservation. Pursuant to section 6(b) of Pub. L. 113–287, set out as a Transitional and Savings Provisions note preceding section 100101 of this title, this section replaces the former provisions as they existed on Jan. 15, 2013, and any amendment to the former provisions enacted after Jan. 15, 2013, is deemed to amend this section. Former section 469n(f) of Title 16 was amended after Jan. 15, 2013, by Pub. L. 113–291, div. B, title XXX, §3033(e), Dec. 19, 2014, 128 Stat. 3777, by inserting ", except that the amount authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section not appropriated as of the date of enactment of the First State National Historical Park Act shall be reduced by $6,500,000" before period at end. [No act with the title First State National Historical Park Act has been enacted. The date of enactment of the First State National Historical Park Act probably means the date of enactment of section 3033 of Pub. L. 113–291, which was approved Dec. 19, 2014. In addition to making the above amendment, section 3033 of Pub. L. 113–291 enacted section 410rrr of Title 16.]
