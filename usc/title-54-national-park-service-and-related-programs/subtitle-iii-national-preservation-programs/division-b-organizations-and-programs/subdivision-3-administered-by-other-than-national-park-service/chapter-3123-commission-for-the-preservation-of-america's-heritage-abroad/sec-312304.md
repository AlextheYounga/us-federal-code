In subsection (a)(2), the word "Secretary" is substituted for "Department" because of 22 U.S.C. 2651 and 2651a(a).

In subsection (b)(3), the words "under section 5376 of title 5" are substituted for "for grade GS–18 of the General Schedule (5 U.S.C. 5332(a))" because of section 529 [title I, §101(c)(1)] of the Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations Act, 1991 (Public Law 101–509, 5 U.S.C. 5376 note).
