The words "National Park System Advisory Board" are substituted for "Advisory Board on National Parks, Historic Sites, Buildings, and Museums" because the Board was renamed when section 3 of the Act of August 21, 1935 (known as the Historic Sites, Buildings, and Antiquities Act (ch. 593, 49 Stat. 667)) was amended by section 9 of Public Law 91–383, as added by section 2 of Public Law 94–458 (90 Stat. 1940).
