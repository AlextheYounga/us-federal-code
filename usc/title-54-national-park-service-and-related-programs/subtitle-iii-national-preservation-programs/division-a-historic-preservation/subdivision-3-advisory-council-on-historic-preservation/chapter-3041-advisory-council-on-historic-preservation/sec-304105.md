In subsection (a), the words "at a rate within the Executive Schedule" are added to retain the ability to hire an Executive Director within the General Schedule. The words "in the competitive service at a rate that may exceed the rate prescribed for the highest rate established for grade 15 of the General Schedule under section 5332 of title 5, or in the Senior Executive Service under section 3393 of title 5" are added for consistency with the intent of the source provision language as it existed in 1966, which included all Federal employees. The language is updated to reflect the existence of the Senior Executive Service and senior level employees above grade 15.

In subsection (c), the words "that exceed that prescribed for the highest rate established for grade 15 of the General Schedule under section 5332 of title 5 or in the Senior Executive Service under section 3393 of title 5" are substituted for "not to exceed that now or hereafter prescribed for the highest rate of grade 15 of the General Schedule under section 5332 of title 5" for consistency with the intent of the source provision language as it existed in 1966, which included all Federal employees. The language is updated to reflect the existence of the Senior Executive Service and senior level employees above grade 15.

In subsection (d), the words "chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5" are substituted for "the Classification Act of 1949" because of section 7(b) of the Act of September 6, 1966 (Public Law 89–554, 80 Stat. 631), the 1st section of which enacted Title 5, United States Code.

In subsection (f)(1), the word "Secretary" is substituted for "Department of the Interior" because of 43 U.S.C. 1451.
