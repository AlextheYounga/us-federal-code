(a) In General.—The Administrator shall prepare the legal description of any historic light station conveyed under this chapter. The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary, may retain all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to any historical artifact, including any lens or lantern, that is associated with the historic light station and located at the historic light station at the time of conveyance.

(b) Artifacts.—Artifacts associated with, but not located at, a historic light station at the time of conveyance shall remain the property of the United States under the administrative control of the Secretary of Homeland Security.

(c) Covenants.—All conditions placed with the quitclaim deed of title to the historic light station shall be construed as covenants running with the land.

(d) Submerged Land.—No submerged land shall be conveyed under this chapter.
