The text of 16 U.S.C. 470w–7(e)(5) is omitted as unnecessary.

In paragraph (3)(A), the words "that is a historic property" are substituted for "provided that the 'historic light station' shall be included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places" because of the definition of "historic property" in section 300308 of the new title.
