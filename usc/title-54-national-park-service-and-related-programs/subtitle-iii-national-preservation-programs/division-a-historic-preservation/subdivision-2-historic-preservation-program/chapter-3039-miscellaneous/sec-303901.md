(c) Consultation.—The Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of the Treasury regarding the interest rate of loans insured under this section.

(d) Limitation on Amount of Unpaid Principal Balance of Loans.—The aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans insured under this section may not exceed the amount that has been deposited in the Historic Preservation Fund but which has not been appropriated for any purpose.

(e) Insurance Contracts.—Any contract of insurance executed by the Secretary under this section may be assignable, shall be an obligation supported by the full faith and credit of the United States, and shall be incontestable except for fraud or misrepresentation of which the holder had actual knowledge at the time it became a holder.

(f) Conditions and Methods of Payment as Result of Loss.—The Secretary shall specify, by regulation and in each contract entered into under this section, the conditions and method of payment to a private lender as a result of losses incurred by the lender on any loan insured under this section.

(j) Treatment of Loans as Non-Federal Funds.—Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any loan insured under this section shall be treated as non-Federal funds for the purposes of satisfying any requirement of any other provision of law under which Federal funds to be used for any project or activity are conditioned on the use of non-Federal funds by the recipient for payment of any portion of the costs of the project or activity.

(k) Ineligibility of Debt Obligation for Purchase or Commitment To Purchase by, or Sale or Issuance to, Federal Financing Bank.—No debt obligation that is made or committed to be made, or that is insured or committed to be insured, by the Secretary under this section shall be eligible for purchase by, or commitment to purchase by, or sale or issuance to, the Federal Financing Bank.
