In subsection (a), the words "except for programs and undertakings exempted" are substituted for "unless exempted" for clarity.

In subsection (b)(2), the words "as are listed in or may be eligible for the National Register" are omitted as unnecessary because of the definition of "historic property" in section 300308 of the new title.
