In subsection (a), the word "Secretary" is substituted for "National Park Service" to reflect the transfer of functions of other officers, employees, and agencies of the Department of the Interior to the Secretary by sections 1 and 2 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1950 (5 U.S.C. App.). The words "in fiscal year 1997 and thereafter" are omitted as obsolete. The words "for the public purpose of carrying out National Park Service programs" are omitted as unnecessary. The words "is a cooperative agreement properly entered into under section 6305 of title 31" are substituted for "pursuant to section 6305 of title 31" for clarity.
