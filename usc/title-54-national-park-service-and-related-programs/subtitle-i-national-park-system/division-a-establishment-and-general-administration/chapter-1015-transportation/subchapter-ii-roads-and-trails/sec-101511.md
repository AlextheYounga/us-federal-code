In subsection (a), the text of 16 U.S.C. 8b (last proviso) and the words "in the administration of the National Park Service" in 16 U.S.C. 8 are omitted as unnecessary.

In subsection (b)(1)(A), the words "at least 90 percent" are substituted for "wholly or to the extent of 90 per centum" to eliminate unnecessary words. The words "National Highway System" are substituted for "Federal 7 per centum highway system" to reflect the current name of the system. See 23:101(a)(16).

In subsection (b)(2)(A), the words "during the fiscal years 1950 and 1951" and the text of 16 U.S.C. 8b (words after semicolon and before 1st proviso) are omitted as obsolete.

In subsection (c), the words "Secretary of Transportation" are substituted for "Secretary of Commerce" because the functions of the Secretary of Agriculture relating to Public Roads Administration were transferred to the Federal Works Administrator by Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1939 (5 App. U.S.C.) and subsequently to the Administrator of General Services by section 103 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (ch. 288, 63 Stat. 380) and the Secretary of Commerce and Secretary of Transportation by Reorganization Plan No. 7 of 1949 (5 App. U.S.C.), as amended by section 2(b) of Public Law 97–449 (96 Stat. 2439).
