|          101521          |   16 U.S.C. 2302   |Pub. L. 95–344, title III, §302, Aug. 15, 1978, 92 Stat. 478; Pub. L. 103–437, §6(d)(18), Nov. 2, 1994, 108 Stat. 4584; Pub. L. 104–333, div. I, title VIII, §814(d)(1)(A), Nov. 12, 1996, 110 Stat. 4195.|

The text of 16 U.S.C. 2302(d) is omitted as superseded by 16 U.S.C. 5981, restated as section 101531 of the new title.

In subsection (d), the words "shall not be considered as concession facilities or services within the meaning of the Act of October 9, 1965 (79 Stat. 969)" are omitted as obsolete because that Act was repealed by section 415(a) of the National Parks Omnibus Management Act of 1998 (Public Law 105–391, 112 Stat. 3515).

In subsection (e), the words "section 13506(a)(9)" are substituted for "section 10526(a)(9)" because of the general amendment of subtitle IV of title 49 by the ICC Termination Act of 1995 (Public Law 104–88, 109 Stat. 802), in which provisions comparable to section 10526(a)(9) were enacted as section 13506(a)(9) (109 Stat. 862). The words "section 10526(a)(9)" previously had been substituted for "section 203(b)(4) of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 U.S.C. 303(b)(4))" because of section 3(b) of the Act of October 17, 1978 (Public Law 95–473, 92 Stat, 1466), the 1st section of which enacted subtitle IV of title 49.
