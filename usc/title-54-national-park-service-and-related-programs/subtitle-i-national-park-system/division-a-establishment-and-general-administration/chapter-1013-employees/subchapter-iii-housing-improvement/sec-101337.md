### §101337. Leasing of seasonal employee quarters ###

(a) General Authority.—The Secretary may lease quarters at or near a System unit for use as seasonal quarters for field employees if the Secretary finds that there is a shortage of adequate and affordable seasonal quarters at or near the System unit and that—

(1) the requirement for the seasonal field employee quarters is temporary; or

(2) leasing would be more cost-effective than construction of new seasonal field employee quarters.

(b) Rent.—The rent charged to field employees under the lease shall be a rate based on the reasonable value of the quarters in accordance with requirements applicable under section 5911 of title 5.

(c) Unrecovered Costs.—The Secretary may pay the unrecovered costs of leasing seasonal quarters under this section from annual appropriations for the year in which the lease is made.
