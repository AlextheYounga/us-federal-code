In subsection (a), the word "Secretary" is substituted for "agency" to correct an error in the source provision because the provision only applies to the Service and the Secretary develops the priority listing.

In subsection (b), the words "for the first fiscal year after November 12, 1996, and .á.á. subsequent" are omitted as obsolete.
