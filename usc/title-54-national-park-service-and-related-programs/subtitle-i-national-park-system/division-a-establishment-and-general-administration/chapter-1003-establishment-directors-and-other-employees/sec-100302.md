In subsection (a)(3), the words "of the Hot Springs Reservation in the State of Arkansas" [changed to "Hot Springs National Park" because of section 1 of the Act of March 4, 1921 (ch. 161, 41 Stat. 1407)] in section 2 of the Act of August 25, 1916 (known as the National Park Service Organic Act) (ch. 408, 39 Stat. 535) are omitted as unnecessary.

Subsection (c) is substituted for the 5th sentence of section 1 of the Act of August 25, 1916 (known as the National Park Service Organic Act) (ch. 408, 39 Stat. 535), to eliminate unnecessary words and because the pay of employees is fixed pursuant to chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5.
