(2) demonstrates to the Secretary that there are no reasonable alternatives by which to acquire or perform the necessary services, resources, or water.

The reimbursements may be credited to the appropriation current at the time reimbursements are received.

(f) Contracts for Utility Facilities.—The Secretary may contract, under terms and conditions that the Secretary considers to be in the interest of the Federal Government, for the sale, operation, maintenance, repair, or relocation of Government-owned electric and telephone lines and other utility facilities used for the administration and protection of the System, regardless of whether the lines and facilities are located within or outside the System.

(A) made from appropriations applicable to the work on which the equipment is used at rental rates established by the Secretary, based on actual or estimated cost of operation, repair, maintenance, depreciation, and equipment management control; and

(B) credited to appropriations currently available at the time adjustment is effected.

(3) Rental of equipment for fire control purposes.—The Secretary may rent equipment for fire control purposes to State, county, private, or other non-Federal agencies that cooperate with the Secretary in the administration of the System and other areas in fire control. The rental shall be under the terms of written cooperative agreements. The amount collected for the rentals shall be credited to appropriations currently available at the time payment is received.
