In subsection (a), the text of 16 U.S.C. 79 (2d proviso) is omitted as obsolete because title 65 of the Revised States of the United States was repealed by section 1 of the Act of July 16, 1947 (ch. 256, 61 Stat. 327).

In subsection (a)(1), the words "and the Yosemite, Sequoia, and General Grant national parks, California" are omitted as unnecessary because "other reservations" encompasses all System units.

The inclusion of paragraphs (4) and (5) of subsection (a) do not have any effect on rights of way under subsection (b).

In subsection (a)(4), the words "or his successor in his discretion" are omitted as unnecessary.

In subsection (b), the text of 16 U.S.C. 5 (last paragraph) is omitted as obsolete. The word "Secretary" is substituted for "the head of the department having jurisdiction over the lands" and "chief officer of the department under whose supervision or control such reservation falls" because the portion of the Act of March 4, 1911 (ch. 238, 36 Stat. 1253) classified to 16 U.S.C. 5 relates only to System units
