### §100731. Findings and declaration ###

Congress finds and declares that—

(1) the level of technology of mineral exploration and development has changed radically, and continued application of the mining laws of the United States to System units to which the mining laws apply conflicts with the purposes for which the System units were established; and

(2) all mining operations in System units should be conducted so as to prevent or minimize damage to the environment and other resource values.
