In subsection (b), the words "In order to facilitate the administration of the national park system" and "and enforce" are omitted as unnecessary. The words "under subsection (a)" are added for clarity to show that a regulation under subsection (b) is a special type of regulation under subsection (a) so that a violation of a regulation under subsection (b) is subject to a criminal penalty under 18 U.S.C. 1865.

Subsection (c) is added for informational purposes.
