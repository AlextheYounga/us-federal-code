### §100754. Relinquishment of legislative jurisdiction ###

(a) In General.—Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may relinquish to a State or a territory (including a possession) of the United States part of the legislative jurisdiction of the United States over System land or interests in land in that State or territory. Relinquishment may be accomplished—

(1) by filing with the chief executive official of the State or territory a notice of relinquishment to take effect on acceptance; or

(2) as the laws of the State or territory may otherwise provide.

(b) Submission of Agreement to Congress.—Prior to consummating a relinquishment under subsection (a), the Secretary shall submit the proposed agreement to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives. The Secretary shall not finalize the agreement until 60 calendar days after the submission has elapsed.

(c) Concurrent Legislative Jurisdiction.—The Secretary shall diligently pursue the consummation of arrangements with each State or territory within which a System unit is located so that insofar as practicable the United States shall exercise concurrent legislative jurisdiction within System units.

In this section, the words "territory (including a possession)" are substituted for "territory, or possession" the 1st time the words appear for clarity, because a possession is a category of territory, that is, one that has very little local autonomy. In subsequent instances, the word "territory" is used in an equivalent sense. The word "Commonwealth" is omitted as being included in "territory (including a possession)".
