#### Purpose; Conformity With Original Intent ####

Pub. L. 113–287, §2, Dec. 19, 2014, 128 Stat. 3094, provided that:

"(a) Purpose.—The purpose of this Act [see Tables for classification] is to codify certain existing laws relating to the National Park System as title 54, United States Code, 'National Park Service and Related Programs'.

"(b) Conformity With Original Intent.—In the codification of laws by this Act, the intent is to conform to the understood policy, intent, and purpose of Congress in the original enactments, with such amendments and corrections as will remove ambiguities, contradictions, and other imperfections, in accordance with section 205(c)(1) of House Resolution No. 988, 93d Congress, as enacted into law by Public Law 93–554 (2 U.S.C. 285b(1))."

#### Transitional and Savings Provisions ####

Pub. L. 113–287, §6, Dec. 19, 2014, 128 Stat. 3272, provided that:

If a law enacted after that date is otherwise inconsistent with a title 54 provision or a provision of this Act [see Tables for classification], that law supersedes the title 54 provision or provision of this Act to the extent of the inconsistency.

"(c) Original Date of Enactment Unchanged.—For purposes of determining whether one provision of law supersedes another based on enactment later in time, a title 54 provision is deemed to have been enacted on the date of enactment of the source provision that the title 54 provision replaces.

"(d) References to Title 54 Provisions.—A reference to a title 54 provision is deemed to refer to the corresponding source provision.

"(e) References to Source Provisions.—A reference to a source provision, including a reference in a regulation, order, or other law, is deemed to refer to the corresponding title 54 provision.

"(f) Regulations, Orders, and Other Administrative Actions.—A regulation, order, or other administrative action in effect under a source provision continues in effect under the corresponding title 54 provision.

"(g) Actions Taken and Offenses Committed.—An action taken or an offense committed under a source provision is deemed to have been taken or committed under the corresponding title 54 provision."
