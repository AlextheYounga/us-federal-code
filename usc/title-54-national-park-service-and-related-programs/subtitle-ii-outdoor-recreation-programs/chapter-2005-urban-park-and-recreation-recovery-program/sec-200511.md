The words "amount made available for grants to all of the States" are substituted for "aggregate amount of funds authorized to be appropriated" for clarity and for consistency in the section.

In subsections (b) and (c), the words "made available for grants" are substituted for "authorized" for clarity and for consistency in the section.

In subsection (b), the words "local park and recreation" are omitted as unnecessary because of the defined term.
