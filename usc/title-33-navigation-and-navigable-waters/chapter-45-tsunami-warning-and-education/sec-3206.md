#### (c) Detection equipment; technical advice and training ####

In carrying out this section, the National Weather Service—

(1) shall give priority to assisting nations in identifying vulnerable coastal areas, creating inundation maps, obtaining or designing real-time detection and reporting equipment, and supporting communication and warning networks and contact points in each vulnerable nation;

(2) may support a process for transfer of detection and communication technology to affected nations for the purposes of supporting the international tsunami warning system; and

(3) shall provide technical and other assistance to support international tsunami programs.
