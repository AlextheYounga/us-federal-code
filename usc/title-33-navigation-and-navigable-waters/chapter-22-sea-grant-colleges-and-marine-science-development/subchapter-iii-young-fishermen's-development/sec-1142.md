### §1142. Establishment of program ###

The Secretary of Commerce, acting through the National Sea Grant Office, shall establish a program to provide training, education, outreach, and technical assistance initiatives for young fishermen, to be known as the 'Young Fishermen's Development Grant Program' (referred to in this section <sup><a href="#1142_1_target" name="1142_1">1</a></sup> as the 'Program').

(Pub. L. 116–289, §3, Jan. 5, 2021, 134 Stat. 4886.)

#### **Editorial Notes** ####

#### Codification ####

Section was enacted as part of the Young Fishermen's Development Act, and not as part of the Marine Resources and Engineering Development Act of 1966 which comprises this chapter.

[<sup>1</sup> So in original. Probably should be "this subchapter".](#1142_1)
