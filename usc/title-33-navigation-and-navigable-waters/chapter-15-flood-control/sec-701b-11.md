### §701b–11. Flood protection projects ###

#### (a) General considerations; nonstructural alternatives ####

In the survey, planning, or design by any Federal agency of any project involving flood protection, consideration shall be given to nonstructural alternatives to prevent or reduce flood damages, with a view toward formulating the most economically, socially, and environmentally acceptable means of reducing or preventing flood damage, including—

(1) floodproofing of structures, including through elevation;

(2) floodplain regulation;

(3) acquisition of floodplain land for recreational, fish and wildlife, and other public purposes;

(4) relocation; and

(5) the use of a feature described in section 2289a(a) of this title.

#### (b) Non-Federal participation through nonstructural alternatives; limitation ####

Where a nonstructural alternative is recommended, non-Federal participation shall be comparable to the value of lands, easements, and rights-of-way which would have been required of non-Federal interests under section 701c of this title, for structural protection measures, but in no event shall exceed 20 per centum of the project costs.
