#### Amendments ####

**1960**—Pub. L. 86–409 struck out provisions which restricted the Coast and Geodetic Survey in the conduct of its specified activities to the United States, its Territories and possessions, and which restricted hydrographic and topographic surveys to surveys of coastal water and land areas (including offlying islands, banks, shoals, and other offshore areas), and to surveys of lakes, rivers, reservoirs, and other inland waters not otherwise provided for by statute.
