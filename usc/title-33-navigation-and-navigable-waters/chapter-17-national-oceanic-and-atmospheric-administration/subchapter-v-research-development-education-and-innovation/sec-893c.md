### §893c. Workforce study ###

#### (a) In general ####

The Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, in cooperation with the Secretary of Education, shall request the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study on the scientific workforce in the areas of oceanic and atmospheric research and development. The study shall investigate—

(1) whether there is a shortage in the number of individuals with advanced degrees in oceanic and atmospheric sciences who have the ability to conduct high quality scientific research in physical and chemical oceanography, meteorology, and atmospheric modeling, and related fields, for government, nonprofit, and private sector entities;

(2) whether there is a shortage in the number of individuals with technical or trade-based degrees, skillsets, or credentials suited to a career in oceanic and atmospheric data collection, processing, satellite production, or satellite operations;

(3) what Federal programs are available to help facilitate the education of students hoping to pursue these degrees, skillsets, or credentials;

(4) barriers to transitioning highly qualified oceanic and atmospheric scientists or highly qualified technical professionals and tradespeople into Federal civil service scientist career tracks;

(5) what institutions of higher education, the private sector, and the Congress could do to increase the number of individuals with such post baccalaureate degrees, skillsets, or credentials;

(6) the impact of an aging Federal workforce on the ability of Federal agencies to conduct high quality scientific research, observations, and monitoring;

(7) what actions the Federal government can take to assist the transition of highly qualified scientists, technical professionals, and tradespeople into Federal career positions;

(8) workforce diversity and actions the Federal Government can take to increase diversity in the scientific workforce; and

(9) actions the Federal Government can take to shorten the hiring backlog for such workforce.

#### (b) Coordination ####

The Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and the Secretary of Education shall consult with the heads of other Federal agencies and departments with oceanic and atmospheric expertise or authority in preparing the specifications for the study.

#### (c) Report ####

No later than 18 months after December 23, 2022, the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and the Secretary of Education shall transmit a joint report to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Natural Resources and the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives, detailing the findings and recommendations of the study and setting forth a prioritized plan to implement the recommendations.

#### (d) Program and plan ####

The Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere shall evaluate the National Academy of Sciences study and develop a workforce program and plan to institutionalize the Administration's Federal science career pathways and address aging workforce issues. The program and plan shall be developed in consultation with the Administration's cooperative institutes and other academic partners.
