(C) an authorizing purpose that is no longer relevant or feasible;

(ii) planning, design, or construction was initiated before October 23, 2018, but for which no funds, Federal or non-Federal, were obligated for planning, design, or construction of the project or separable element of the project during the current fiscal year or any of the 6 preceding fiscal years;

(B) each project or separable element of a project identified and included on a list to Congress for deauthorization pursuant to section 579a(b)(2) of this title; and
