The date of the enactment of the National Ocean Exploration Act, referred to in subsec. (a), probably means the date of enactment of Pub. L. 117–263, which was approved Dec. 23, 2022. Prior versions of the bill that was enacted into law as title CIII of div. J of Pub. L. 117–263 included such Short Title, but it was not enacted as part of Pub. L. 117–263.

Section 5405 of the National Ocean Exploration Act, referred to in subsec. (g), probably means section 10304 of Pub. L. 117–263, which established the National Ocean Mapping, Exploration, and Characterization Council and is classified to section 3408 of this title. Prior versions of the bill that was enacted into law as title CIII of div. J of Pub. L. 117–263 included such Short Title, but it was not enacted as part of Pub. L. 117–263. Pub.
