#### (3) Coastal waters ####

The term "coastal waters" has the meaning given the term in such section.

#### (4) Covered data ####

The term "covered data" means, with respect to a named storm identified by the Administrator under subsection (b)(2)(A), empirical data that are—

(A) collected before, during, or after such storm; and

(B) necessary to determine magnitude and timing of wind speeds, rainfall, the barometric pressure, river flows, the extent, height, and timing of storm surge, topographic and bathymetric data, and other measures required to accurately model and assess damage from such storm.

#### (5) Indeterminate loss ####

The term "indeterminate loss" has the meaning given the term in section 4057(a) of title 42.

#### (6) Named storm ####

The term "named storm" means any organized weather system with a defined surface circulation and maximum sustained winds of at least 39 miles per hour which the National Hurricane Center of the United States National Weather Service names as a tropical storm or a hurricane.

#### (7) Named Storm Event Model ####

The term "Named Storm Event Model" means the official meteorological and oceanographic computerized model, developed by the Administrator under subsection (b)(1)(A), which utilizes covered data to replicate the magnitude, timing, and spatial variations of winds, rainfall, and storm surges associated with named storms for which post-storm assessments are conducted.

The term "participant" means a Federal, State, or private entity that chooses to cooperate with the Administrator in carrying out the provisions of this section by collecting, contributing, and maintaining covered data.

#### (9) Post-storm assessment ####

The term "post-storm assessment" means a scientific assessment produced and certified by the Administrator to determine the magnitude, timing, and spatial variations of winds, rainfall, and storm surges associated with a specific named storm to be used in the COASTAL Formula.

#### (10) State ####

The term "State" means a State of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and any other territory or possession of the United States.

#### (b) Named Storm Event Model and post-storm assessment ####

#### (1) Establishment of Named Storm Event Model ####

#### (A) In general ####

Not later than December 31, 2020, the Administrator shall develop the Named Storm Event Model.

#### (B) Accuracy ####

The Named Storm Event Model shall be designed to generate post-storm assessments, as provided in paragraph (2), that have a degree of accuracy of not less than 90 percent for an indeterminate loss for which a post-storm assessment is utilized.

#### (C) Public review ####

The Administrator shall seek input and suggestions from the public before the Named Storm Event Model, or any modification to the Named Storm Event Model, takes effect.

#### (2) Post-storm assessment ####

#### (A) Identification of named storms threatening coastal States ####

After the establishment of the COASTAL Formula, the Administrator shall, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, identify named storms that may reasonably constitute a threat to any portion of a coastal State.

#### (B) Data collection ####

#### (i) In general ####

Upon identification of a named storm under subparagraph (A), and pursuant to the protocol established under subsection (c), the Administrator may deploy sensors to enhance the collection of covered data in the areas in coastal States that the Administrator determines are at the highest risk of experiencing geophysical events that would cause indeterminate losses.

#### (ii) Rule of construction ####

If the Administrator takes action under clause (i), that action may not be construed as indicating that a post-storm assessment will be developed for any coastal State in which that action is taken.

#### (C) Identification of indeterminate losses in coastal States ####

Not later than 30 days after the first date on which sustained winds of not less than 39 miles per hour are measured in a coastal State during a named storm identified under subparagraph (A), the Secretary of Homeland Security shall notify the Administrator with respect to the existence of any indeterminate losses in that coastal State resulting from that named storm.

#### (D) Post-storm assessment required ####

Upon confirmation of indeterminate losses identified under subparagraph (C) with respect to a named storm, the Administrator shall develop a post-storm assessment for each coastal State that suffered such indeterminate losses as a result of the named storm using the Named Storm Event Model and covered data collected for such named storm pursuant to the protocol established under subsection (c)(1).

#### (E) Submittal of post-storm assessment ####

Not later than 90 days after any indeterminate losses are identified under subparagraph (C), the Administrator shall submit to the Secretary of Homeland Security the post-storm assessment developed under subparagraph (D) for any coastal State that suffered such indeterminate losses.

#### (F) Separate post-storm assessments for a single named storm ####

#### (i) In general ####

The Administrator may conduct a separate post-storm assessment for each coastal State in which indeterminate losses are identified under subparagraph (C).

#### (ii) Timeline ####

If the Administrator conducts a separate post-storm assessment under clause (i), the Administrator shall complete the assessment based on the dates of actions that the Administrator takes under subparagraph (D).

#### (3) Accuracy ####

The Administrator shall ensure, to the greatest extent practicable, that each post-storm assessment developed under paragraph (2) has a degree of accuracy of not less than 90 percent.

#### (4) Certification ####

For each post-storm assessment carried out under paragraph (2), the Administrator shall—

(A) certify the degree of accuracy for such assessment, including specific reference to any segments or geographic areas for which the assessment is less than 90 percent accurate; and

(B) report such certification to the Secretary of Homeland Security for the purposes of use with indeterminate loss claims under section 4057 of title 42.

#### (5) Finality of determinations ####

A certification of the degree of accuracy of a post-storm assessment under this subsection by the Administrator shall be final and shall not be subject to judicial review.

#### (6) Availability ####

The Administrator shall make available to the public the Named Storm Event Model and any post-storm assessment developed under this subsection.

#### (c) Establishment of a protocol for post-storm assessment ####

#### (1) In general ####

#### (3) Use of Federal assets ####

If the protocol requires placement of a sensor to develop assessments pursuant to subsection (b), the Administrator shall, to the extent practicable, use Federal assets for the placement of such sensors.

#### (4) Use of acquired structures ####
