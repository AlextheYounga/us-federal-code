#### (c) Consultation ####

In developing strategies under subsection (a), the Secretary shall consult with interested Federal agencies, States, and Indian tribes and provide an opportunity for public comment.

#### (d) Dredged material disposal ####

#### (1) Study ####

The Secretary shall conduct a study to determine the feasibility of constructing and operating an underwater confined dredged material disposal site in the Port of New York-New Jersey that could accommodate as much as 250,000 cubic yards of dredged material for the purpose of demonstrating the feasibility of an underwater confined disposal pit as an environmentally suitable method of containing certain sediments.

#### (2) Report ####

In consultation and coordination with the Great Lakes States, the Secretary shall develop a tributary sediment transport model for each major river system or set of major river systems depositing sediment into a Great Lakes federally authorized commercial harbor, channel maintenance project site, or Area of Concern identified under the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 1978. Such model may be developed as a part of a strategy developed under subsection (a).

#### (2) Requirements for models ####

In developing a tributary sediment transport model under this subsection, the Secretary shall build on data and monitoring information generated in earlier studies and programs of the Great Lakes and their tributaries.

#### (3) Report ####

Not later than December 31, 2003, the Secretary shall transmit to Congress a report on the Secretary's activities under this subsection.

#### (f) "Great Lakes States" defined ####
