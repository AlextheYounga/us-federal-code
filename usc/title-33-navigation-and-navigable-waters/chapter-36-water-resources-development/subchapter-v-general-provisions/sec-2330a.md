In conducting a feasibility study for a project (or a component of a project) for ecosystem restoration, the Secretary shall ensure that the recommended project includes, as an integral part of the project, a plan for monitoring the success of the ecosystem restoration.

#### (b) Monitoring plan ####

The monitoring plan shall—

(1) include a description of the monitoring activities to be carried out, the criteria for ecosystem restoration success, and the estimated cost and duration of the monitoring; and

#### (c) Cost share ####

For a period of 10 years from completion of construction of a project (or a component of a project) for ecosystem restoration, the Secretary shall consider the cost of carrying out the monitoring as a project cost.

#### (e) Conclusion of operation and maintenance responsibility ####

The responsibility of a non-Federal interest for operation and maintenance of the nonstructural and nonmechanical elements of a project, or a component of a project, for ecosystem restoration shall cease 10 years after the date on which the Secretary makes a determination of success under subsection (b)(2).
