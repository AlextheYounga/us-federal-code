#### (2) Guidelines ####

To assist non-Federal interests, the Secretary, as soon as practicable, shall issue guidelines for the formulation of feasibility studies of water resources development projects undertaken by non-Federal interests to—

The Secretary shall review each feasibility study received under subsection (a)(1) for the purpose of determining whether or not the study, and the process under which the study was developed, each comply with Federal laws and regulations applicable to feasibility studies of water resources development projects.

#### (2) Timing ####

The Secretary may not submit to Congress an assessment of a feasibility study under this section until such time as the Secretary—

(A) determines that the feasibility study complies with all of the requirements that would apply to a feasibility study undertaken by the Secretary; and

(B) completes all of the Federal analyses, reviews, and compliance processes under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), that would be required with respect to the proposed project if the Secretary had undertaken the feasibility study.

#### (3) Initiation of review ####

#### (A) Request ####

#### (i) Submission ####

The non-Federal interest may submit to the Secretary a request that the Secretary initiate the analyses, reviews, and compliance processes described in paragraph (2)(B) with respect to the proposed project prior to the non-Federal interest's submission of a feasibility study under subsection (a)(1).

#### (ii) Effect ####

Receipt by the Secretary of a request submitted under clause (i) shall be considered the receipt of a proposal or application that will lead to a major Federal action that is subject to the requirements of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) that would be required if the Secretary were to undertake the feasibility study.

(C) any conditions the Secretary may require for construction of the project.

#### (2) Limitation ####

The completion of the review by the Secretary of a feasibility study that has been submitted under subsection (a)(1) may not be delayed as a result of consideration being given to changes in policy or priority with respect to project consideration.

#### (d) Credit ####

If a project for which a feasibility study has been submitted under subsection (a)(1) is authorized by a Federal law enacted after the date of the submission to Congress under subsection (c), the Secretary shall credit toward the non-Federal share of the cost of construction of the project an amount equal to the portion of the cost of developing the study that would have been the responsibility of the United States if the study had been developed by the Secretary.
