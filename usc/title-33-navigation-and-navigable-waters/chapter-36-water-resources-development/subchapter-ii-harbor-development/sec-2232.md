(2) a completed feasibility study developed under section 2231 of this title; or

(3) a final feasibility study for water resources development and conservation and other purposes that is specifically authorized by Congress to be carried out by the Secretary.

#### (b) Authority ####

#### (1) In general ####

A non-Federal interest may carry out a federally authorized water resources development project, or separable element thereof—

(A) in accordance with a plan approved by the Secretary for the project or separable element; and

(B) subject to any conditions that the Secretary may require, including any conditions specified under section 2231(c)(3) of this title.

(B) ensure that a final environmental impact statement or environmental assessment, as appropriate, for the project or separable element has been filed.

#### (3) Permit exception ####

#### (A) In general ####

For a project described in subsection (a)(1) or subsection (a)(3), or a separable element thereof, with respect to which a written agreement described in subparagraph (B) has been entered into, a non-Federal interest that carries out a project under this section shall not be required to obtain any Federal permits or approvals that would not be required if the Secretary carried out the project or separable element unless significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns or compliance have arisen since development of the project recommendation.

#### (B) Written agreement ####

For purposes of this paragraph, a written agreement shall provide that the non-Federal interest shall comply with the same legal and technical requirements that would apply if the project or separable element were carried out by the Secretary, including all mitigation required to offset environmental impacts of the project or separable element as determined by the Secretary.

#### (C) Certifications ####

Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), if a non-Federal interest carrying out a project under this section would, in the absence of a written agreement entered into under this paragraph, be required to obtain a certification from a State under Federal law to carry out the project, such certification shall still be required if a written agreement is entered into with respect to the project under this paragraph.

#### (4) Data sharing ####

#### (A) In general ####

If a non-Federal interest for a water resources development project begins to carry out that water resources development project under this section, the non-Federal interest may request that the Secretary transfer to the non-Federal interest all relevant data and documentation under the control of the Secretary with respect to that water resources development project.

#### (B) Deadline ####

Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the Secretary shall transfer the data and documentation requested by a non-Federal interest under subparagraph (A) not later than the date that is 90 days after the date on which the non-Federal interest so requests such data and documentation.

#### (C) Limitation ####

Nothing in this paragraph obligates the Secretary to share any data or documentation that the Secretary considers to be proprietary information.

#### (c) Studies and engineering ####

#### (1) In general ####

When requested by an appropriate non-Federal interest, the Secretary shall undertake all necessary studies, engineering, and technical assistance on construction for any project to be undertaken under this section, and provide technical assistance in obtaining all necessary permits for the construction, if the non-Federal interest contracts with the Secretary to furnish the United States funds for the studies, engineering, or technical assistance on construction in the period during which the studies, engineering, or technical assistance on construction are being conducted.

The Secretary may apply credit toward—

(A) the non-Federal share of authorized separable elements of the same project; or
