(B) less intrusive measures are not reasonably available to reduce such supply chain risk; and

(C) the use of such authorities will apply to a single covered procurement or a class of covered procurements, and otherwise specifies the scope of the determination; and

(4) providing a classified or unclassified notice of the determination made under paragraph (3) to the appropriate congressional committees and leadership that includes—

(A) the joint recommendation described in paragraph (1);

(B) a summary of any risk assessment reviewed in support of the joint recommendation required by paragraph (1); and

(C) a summary of the basis for the determination, including a discussion of less intrusive measures that were considered and why such measures were not reasonably available to reduce supply chain risk.
