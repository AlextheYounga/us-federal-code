“(a) Purpose.—The purpose of this Act [see Tables for classification] is to enact certain laws relating to public contracts as title 41, United States Code, ‘Public Contracts’.

“(b) Conformity With Original Intent.—In the codification of laws by this Act, the intent is to conform to the understood policy, intent, and purpose of Congress in the original enactments, with such amendments and corrections as will remove ambiguities, contradictions, and other imperfections, in accordance with section 205(c)(1) of House Resolution No. 988, 93d Congress, as enacted into law by Public Law 93–554 (2 U.S.C. 285b(1)).”

If a law enacted after that date is otherwise inconsistent with this Act, it supersedes this Act to the extent of the inconsistency.

“(b) Original Date of Enactment Unchanged.—For purposes of determining whether one provision of law supersedes another based on enactment later in time, the date of enactment of a provision enacted by this Act is deemed to be the date of enactment of the provision it replaced.

“(c) References to Provisions Replaced.—A reference to a provision of law replaced by this Act, including a reference in a regulation, order, or other law, is deemed to refer to the corresponding provision enacted by this Act.

“(d) Regulations, Orders, and Other Administrative Actions.—A regulation, order, or other administrative action in effect under a provision of law replaced by this Act continues in effect under the corresponding provision enacted by this Act.

Pub. L. 111–350, §7(a), Jan. 4, 2011, 124 Stat. 3855, provided that: “The repeal of a law by this Act [see Tables for classification] may not be construed as a legislative inference that the provision was or was not in effect before its repeal.”
