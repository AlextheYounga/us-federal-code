### §1603. Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Reimbursement Program ###

#### (a) In general ####

The Commission shall establish a reimbursement program, to be known as the "Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Reimbursement Program", to make reimbursements to providers of advanced communications service to replace covered communications equipment or services.

#### (b) Eligibility ####

The Commission may not make a reimbursement under the Program to a provider of advanced communications service unless the provider—

(1) has 2,000,000 or fewer customers; and

(2) makes all of the certifications required by subsection (d)(4).

#### (c) Use of funds ####

#### (1) In general ####

A recipient of a reimbursement under the Program shall use reimbursement funds solely for the purposes of—

(A) permanently removing covered communications equipment or services purchased, rented, leased, or otherwise obtained before—

(i) in the case of any covered communications equipment or services that are on the initial list published under section 1601(a) of this title, August 14, 2018; or

(ii) in the case of any covered communications equipment or services that are not on the initial list published under section 1601(a) of this title, the date that is 60 days after the date on which the Commission places such equipment or services on the list required by such section;

(B) replacing the covered communications equipment or services removed as described in subparagraph (A) with communications equipment or services that are not covered communications equipment or services; and

(C) disposing of the covered communications equipment or services removed as described in subparagraph (A) in accordance with the requirements under subsection (d)(7).

#### (2) Limitations ####

A recipient of a reimbursement under the Program may not—

(A) use reimbursement funds to remove, replace, or dispose of any covered communications equipment or service purchased, rented, leased, or otherwise obtained on or after—

(i) in the case of any covered communications equipment or service that is on the initial list published under section 1601(a) of this title, August 14, 2018; or

(ii) in the case of any covered communications equipment or service that is not on the initial list published under section 1601(a) of this title, the date that is 60 days after the date on which the Commission places such equipment or service on the list required by such section; or

(B) purchase, rent, lease, or otherwise obtain any covered communications equipment or service, using reimbursement funds or any other funds (including funds derived from private sources).

#### (d) Implementation ####

#### (1) Suggested replacements ####

#### (A) Development of list ####

The Commission shall develop a list of suggested replacements of both physical and virtual communications equipment, application and management software, and services or categories of replacements of both physical and virtual communications equipment, application and management software and services.

#### (B) Neutrality ####

The list developed under subparagraph (A) shall be technology neutral and may not advantage the use of reimbursement funds for capital expenditures over operational expenditures, to the extent that the Commission determines that communications services can serve as an adequate substitute for the installation of communications equipment.

#### (2) Application process ####

#### (A) In general ####

The Commission shall develop an application process and related forms and materials for the Program.

#### (B) Cost estimate ####

#### (i) Initial estimate ####

The Commission shall require an applicant to provide an initial reimbursement cost estimate at the time of application, with supporting materials substantiating the costs.

#### (ii) Updates ####

(II) submit additional supporting materials substantiating an updated cost estimate submitted under subclause (I).

#### (A) Deadline ####

#### (i) In general ####

Except as provided in clause (ii) and subparagraph (B), the Commission shall approve or deny an application for a reimbursement under the Program not later than 90 days after the date of the submission of the application.

#### (ii) Additional time needed by Commission ####

If the Commission determines that, because an excessive number of applications have been filed at one time, the Commission needs additional time for employees of the Commission to process the applications, the Commission may extend the deadline described in clause (i) for not more than 45 days.

#### (B) Opportunity for applicant to cure deficiency ####

If the Commission determines that an application is materially deficient (including by lacking an adequate cost estimate or adequate supporting materials), the Commission shall provide the applicant a 15-day period to cure the defect before denying the application. If such period would extend beyond the deadline under subparagraph (A) for approving or denying the application, such deadline shall be extended through the end of such period.

#### (C) Effect of denial ####

Denial of an application for a reimbursement under the Program shall not preclude the applicant from resubmitting the application or submitting a new application for a reimbursement under the Program at a later date.
