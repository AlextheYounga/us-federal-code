#### Findings ####

Pub. L. 113–197, §2, Nov. 26, 2014, 128 Stat. 2055, provided that: "Congress finds the following:

"(1) The Federal Communications Commission (referred to in this section as the 'Commission') first standardized physical labels for licensed products such as computers, phones, and other electronic devices in 1973, and the Commission has continually refined physical label requirements over time.

"(2) As devices become smaller, compliance with physical label requirements can become more difficult and costly.

"(3) Many manufacturers and consumers of licensed devices in the United States would prefer to have the option to provide or receive important Commission labeling information digitally on the screen of the device, at the discretion of the user.

"(4) An electronic labeling option would give flexibility to manufacturers in meeting labeling requirements."
