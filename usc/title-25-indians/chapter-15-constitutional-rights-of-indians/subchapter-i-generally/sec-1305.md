#### Findings; Purposes ####

Pub. L. 117–103, div. W, title VIII, §811, Mar. 15, 2022, 136 Stat. 904, provided that:

"(a) Findings.—Congress finds that—

"(1) according to the report of the Indian Law and Order Commission established by section 15 of the Indian Law Enforcement Reform Act (25 U.S.C. 2812), Alaska Native women—

"(A) are overrepresented in the domestic violence victim population by 250 percent;

"(B) in the State of Alaska, comprise—

"(i) 19 percent of the population of the State; but

"(ii) 47 percent of reported rape victims in the State; and

"(2) most Alaska Native villages are located in remote areas that—

Their governments are best positioned to effectively arrest, prosecute, and punish, and they should have the authority to do so-or to work out voluntary agreements with each other, and with local governments and the State on mutually beneficial terms'; and

"(4) the unique legal relationship of the United States to Indian Tribes creates a Federal trust responsibility to assist Tribal governments in safeguarding the lives of Indian women.
