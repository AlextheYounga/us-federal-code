"(3) although progress has been made, the Federal bureaucracy, with its centralized rules and regulations, has eroded tribal self-governance and dominates tribal affairs;

"(4) the Tribal Self-Governance Demonstration Project [see Pub. L. 93–638, title III, as added by Pub. L. 100–472, title II, §209, Oct. 5, 1988, 102 Stat. 2296, formerly set out as a note under former 25 U.S.C. 450f] was designed to improve and perpetuate the government-to-government relationship between Indian tribes and the United States and to strengthen tribal control over Federal funding and program management; and

"(5) Congress has reviewed the results of the Tribal Self-Governance Demonstration Project and finds that—

"(A) transferring control to tribal governments, upon tribal request, over funding and decisionmaking for Federal programs, services, functions, and activities, or portions thereof, is an effective way to implement the Federal policy of government-to-government relations with Indian tribes; and

"(B) transferring control to tribal governments, upon tribal request, over funding and decisionmaking for Federal programs, services, functions, and activities strengthens the Federal policy of Indian self-determination."

"(3) to coexist with the provisions of the Indian Self-Determination Act [title I of Pub. L. 93–638, see Short Title note set out under section 5301 of this title] relating to the provision of Indian services by designated Federal agencies;

"(4) to ensure the continuation of the trust responsibility of the United States to Indian tribes and Indian individuals;
