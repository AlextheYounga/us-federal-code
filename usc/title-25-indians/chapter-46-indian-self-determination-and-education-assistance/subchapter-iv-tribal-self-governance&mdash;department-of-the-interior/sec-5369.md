Except as otherwise provided by law (including section 101(a) of the PROGRESS for Indian Tribes Act), the Secretary shall interpret each Federal law and regulation in a manner that facilitates—

(2) the implementation of funding agreements.

#### (b) Regulation waiver ####

#### (1) Request ####

An Indian Tribe may submit to the Secretary a written request for a waiver of applicability of a Federal regulation, including—

(A) an identification of the specific text in the regulation sought to be waived; and

(B) the basis for the request.

#### (4) Designated officials ####

The Secretary shall designate one or more appropriate officials in the Department to receive a copy of the waiver request described in paragraph (1).

#### (5) Grounds for denial ####
