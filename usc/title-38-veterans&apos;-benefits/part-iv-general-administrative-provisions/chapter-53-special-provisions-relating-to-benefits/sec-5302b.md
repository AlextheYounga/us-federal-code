(B) is attributable to the failure of an employee or official of the Department to process information provided by or on behalf of that individual within applicable timeliness standards established by the Secretary.

(2) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the penal and forfeiture provisions for fiduciaries set forth in chapter 61 of this title.

(b) Notice.—(1) If the Secretary determines that the Secretary has made an overpayment to an individual, the Secretary shall provide notice to the individual of the overpayment.

(2) Notice under paragraph (1) shall include a detailed explanation of the right of the individual—

(c) Delay on Collection.—(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary may not take any action under section 3711 of title 31 regarding an overpayment described in a notice under subsection (b) of this section until the date that is 90 days after the date the Secretary issues such notice.

(2) The Secretary may take action under section 3711 of title 31 regarding an overpayment described in a notice under subsection (b) of this section before the date that is 90 days after the date the Secretary issues such notice if the Secretary determines that delaying such action is—
