(C) The term "substantial misrepresentation" means misrepresentation in which the person to whom it was made could reasonably be expected to rely, or has reasonably relied, to that person's detriment.

(c) Limitation on Certain Commissions, Bonuses, and Other Incentive Payments.—An educational institution with a course or program of education approved under this chapter, and an entity that owns such an educational institution, shall not provide any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid to any persons or entities engaged in any student recruiting or admission activities or in making decisions regarding the award of student financial assistance.

(d) Requirement to Maintain Records.—(1) To ensure compliance with this section, any educational institution offering courses approved for the enrollment of eligible persons or veterans shall maintain a complete record of all advertising, sales, or enrollment materials (and copies thereof) utilized by or on behalf of the institution during the preceding two-year period.

(2) Such materials shall include but are not limited to any direct mail pieces, brochures, printed literature used by sales persons, films, video tapes, and audio tapes disseminated through broadcast media, material disseminated through print, digital, or electronic media, tear sheets, leaflets, handbills, fliers, and any sales or recruitment manuals used to instruct sales personnel, agents, or representatives of such institution.

(iv) include—

(I) a process for receipt of findings from a third-party pertinent to this section; and

(II) a process for an educational institution or an owner to provide such information as the educational institution or owner determines appropriate to the Secretary, including information about corrective actions the educational institution or owner may have taken in response to preliminary findings under paragraph (1).

(C) The process established under subparagraph (A) shall not prohibit a State approving agency from—

(i) independently investigating a potential violation of subsection (a), (c), or (d); or

(ii) taking action if the State approving agency finds a violation of subsection (a), (c), or (d).

(3) Upon a preliminary finding under this subsection of a violation of subsection (a), (c), or (d) by an educational institution, or the owner of an educational institution, the Under Secretary shall require the educational institution or owner to submit to the Under Secretary a report prepared by an approved third-party auditor of the advertising and enrollment practices of the educational institution or owner.

(4)(A) Before making a final determination under this subsection regarding a violation of subsection (a), (c), or (d) by an educational institution or owner of an educational institution, the Under Secretary shall—

(i) review the practices of the educational institution or owner that pertain to activities and practices covered by subsections (a), (c), and (d);

(II) in a case in which a report was submitted under subsection (f)(3), such report;

(III) the report submitted under paragraph (3);

(IV) any findings and results submitted under subsection (e)(3);

(V) the marketing and outreach material of the educational institution and the contractors of the educational institution.

(B) The Under Secretary may not make a final determination under this subsection solely based on preliminary findings.

(5) The Under Secretary may not delegate authority to make a final determination under this subsection, including to any employee of the Department or to the Federal Trade Commission.

(h) Enforcement.—(1)(A) Upon a final determination by the Under Secretary for Benefits under subsection (g) that an educational institution or the owner of an educational institution violated subsection (a), (c), or (d), the Under Secretary shall, but subject to subparagraphs (B), (C), and (D) of this paragraph, take one of the following actions independent of any actions taken under section 3690 of this title:

(i) Publish a caution flag on the GI Bill Comparison Tool, or successor tool, about that educational institution and alert its currently enrolled eligible veterans and eligible persons.

(iii) Revoke the approval of the courses and programs of education offered by the educational institution by disapproving all enrollments of eligible veterans and eligible persons in each course or program of education offered by that educational institution.

(B) In deciding upon a course of action under subparagraph (A), for the first violation of this section, the Secretary shall consider the factors set forth in paragraph (2).

(C) Subject to subsection (i), any repeat violation and final finding within five years of the first violation of this section shall result in—

(i) a suspension of approval of new enrollments as described in subparagraph (A)(ii) of this paragraph until reinstatement under subsection (j); or

(ii) a revocation of approval under this chapter as described in subparagraph (A)(iii) of this paragraph until reinstatement under subsection (j).

(D) Subject to subsection (i), any third violation within three years of the second violation of this section shall result in revocation of approval under this chapter as described in subparagraph (A)(iii) of this paragraph until reinstatement under subsection (j).

(E) Any action taken under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph regarding a violation of subsection (a), (c), or (d) by an educational institution or the owner of an educational institution shall be taken on or before the date that is 180 days after the date on which the Under Secretary provided notice to the educational institution or owner regarding the violation in accordance with the process established under subsection (g)(2)(B)(iii).

(2) The factors set forth in this paragraph are the following:

(A) That the Secretary's action brings sufficient deterrence for future fraud against students and the programs of education carried out under this title. Fraud against veterans must be met with a repercussion strong enough to send a deterrent message to this and other educational institutions and owners.

(B) That the educational institution has secured an approved third-party auditor to verify the educational institution's, or owner's, advertising and enrollment practices for at least three years going forward.

(C) That the educational institution or owner has repudiated the deceptive practices and has communicated to all employees that deceptive practices will not be tolerated, and has instituted strong governance procedures to prevent recurrence.

(D) That the educational institution has taken steps to remove any pressure on its enrollment recruiters, including by removing enrollment quotas and incentives for enrollment.

(E) That the State approving agency or the Secretary acting in the role of the State approving agency, has completed a risk-based survey and determined the educational institution is worthy of serving eligible veterans and eligible persons.

(3) Enforcement action under this section shall not preclude enforcement action under section 3690 of this title.

(4) No action may be carried out under this subsection with respect to a final determination by the Under Secretary under subsection (g) while such final determination is pending review under subsection (i).

(i) Appeals.—(1) The Secretary shall establish a process by which an educational institution or the owner of an educational institution that is the subject of more than one final determination by the Under Secretary under subsection (g)(1) that the educational institution or owner violated subsection (a), may request a review of the most recent final determination.

(2)(A) The Secretary shall—

(i) review each final determination for which a review is requested under paragraph (1); and

(ii) pursuant to such review, issue a final decision sustaining, modifying, or overturning the final determination.

(B) The Secretary may not delegate any decision under subparagraph (A).

(C)(i) Review under subparagraph (A)(i) of this paragraph shall be the exclusive avenue for review of a final determination under subsection (g)(1).
