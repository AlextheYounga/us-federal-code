#### **Editorial Notes** ####

#### Codification ####

Section 2208(a)(2) of Pub. L. 116–315 redesignated subsecs. (f), (g), and (h) of this section as (g), (h), and (i), respectively, effective on Jan. 5, 2021. However, this section did not contain subsecs. (g) and (h) until their addition by section 2205(a)(3) and (4)(A) of Pub. L. 116–315, which was not effective until 2 years after Jan. 5, 2021. The redesignations of subsecs. (g) and (h) were executed to reflect the probable intent of Congress, notwithstanding that they were redesignated 2 years before they existed. By the same token, the amendment by section 2205(a)(4)(A), which redesignated subsec. (f)(3) as (h), was executed to subsec. (g)(3) as the probable intent of Congress because the redesignation of subsec. (f) as (g) by section 2208(a)(2) had already taken effect. See 2021 Amendment notes below.
