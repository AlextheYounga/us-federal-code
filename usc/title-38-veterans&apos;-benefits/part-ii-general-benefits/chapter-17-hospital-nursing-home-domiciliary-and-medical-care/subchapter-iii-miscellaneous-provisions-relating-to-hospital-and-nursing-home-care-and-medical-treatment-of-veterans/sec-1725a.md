(2) has received care under this chapter within the 24-month period preceding the furnishing of walk-in care under this section.

(e) Continuity of Care.—The Secretary shall ensure continuity of care for those eligible veterans who receive walk-in care services under this section, including through the establishment of a mechanism to receive medical records from walk-in care providers and provide pertinent patient medical records to providers of walk-in care.
