### §1786. Care for newborn children of women veterans receiving maternity care ###

(a) In General.—The Secretary may furnish health care services described in subsection (b) and transportation necessary to receive such services to a newborn child of a woman veteran who is receiving maternity care furnished by the Department for not more than seven days after the birth of the child if the veteran delivered the child in—

(1) a facility of the Department;

(2) another facility pursuant to a Department contract for services relating to such delivery; or

(3) another location, including a health care facility, if the veteran delivers the child before arriving at a facility described in paragraph (1) or (2).

(b) Covered Health Care Services.—Health care services described in this subsection are all post-delivery care services, including routine care services, that a newborn child requires, including necessary health care services provided by a facility other than the facility where the newborn child was delivered (including a specialty pediatric hospital) that accepts transfer of the newborn child and responsibility for treatment of the newborn child.

(d) <sup><a href="#1786_1_target" name="1786_1">1</a></sup> Transportation.—(1) Transportation furnished under subsection (a) to, from, or between care settings to meet the needs of a newborn child includes costs for either or both the newborn child and parents.

(2) Transportation furnished under subsection (a) includes transportation by ambulance, including air ambulance, or other appropriate medically staffed modes of transportation—

(A) to another health care facility (including a specialty pediatric hospital) that accepts transfer of the newborn child or otherwise provides post-delivery care services when the treating facility is not capable of furnishing the care or services required; or

(B) to a health care facility in a medical emergency of such nature that a prudent layperson reasonably expects that delay in seeking immediate medical attention would be hazardous to life or health.

(3) Amounts paid by the Department for transportation under this section shall be derived from the Medical Services appropriations account of the Department.

(e) Reimbursement or Payment for Health Care Services or Transportation.—(1) Pursuant to regulations the Secretary shall prescribe to establish rates of reimbursement and any limitations thereto under this section, the Secretary shall directly reimburse a covered entity for health care services or transportation services provided under this section, unless the cost of the services or transportation is covered by an established agreement or contract. If such an agreement or contract exists, its negotiated payment terms shall apply.

(2)(A) Reimbursement or payment by the Secretary under this section on behalf of an individual to a covered entity shall, unless rejected and refunded by the covered entity within 30 days of receipt, extinguish any liability on the part of the individual for the health care services or transportation covered by such payment.

(B) Neither the absence of a contract or agreement between the Secretary and a covered entity nor any provision of a contract, agreement, or assignment to the contrary shall operate to modify, limit, or negate the requirements of subparagraph (A).

(3) In this subsection, the term "covered entity" means any individual, transportation carrier, organization, or other entity that furnished or paid for health care services or transportation under this section.
