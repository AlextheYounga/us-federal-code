### §31*l*. Earth Mapping Resources Initiative ###

#### (a) Definition of critical mineral ####

In this section, the term "critical mineral" has the meaning given the term in section 1606(a) of title 30.

#### (b) Establishment ####

There is established within the United States Geological Survey an initiative, to be known as the "Earth Mapping Resources Initiative" (referred to in this section as the "Initiative").

#### (c) Purpose ####

The purpose of the Initiative shall be to accelerate efforts to carry out the fundamental resources and mapping mission of the United States Geological Survey by—

(1) providing integrated topographic, geologic, geochemical, and geophysical mapping;

(2) accelerating the integration and consolidation of geospatial and resource data; and

(3) providing interpretation of subsurface and above-ground mineral resources data.

#### (d) Cooperative agreements ####

#### (1) In general ####

In carrying out the Initiative, the Director of the United States Geological Survey may enter into cooperative agreements with State geological surveys.

#### (2) Effect ####

Nothing in paragraph (1) precludes the Director of the United States Geological Survey from using existing contracting authorities in carrying out the Initiative.

#### (e) Comprehensive mapping modernization ####

#### (1) In general ####

Not later than 10 years after November 15, 2021, the Initiative shall complete an initial comprehensive national modern surface and subsurface mapping and data integration effort.

#### (2) Approach ####

In carrying out paragraph (1) with regard to minerals, mineralization, and mineral deposits, the Initiative shall focus on the full range of minerals, using a whole ore body approach rather than a single commodity approach, to emphasize all of the recoverable critical minerals in a given surface or subsurface deposit.

#### (3) Priority ####

In carrying out paragraph (1) with regard to minerals, mineralization, and mineral deposits, the Initiative shall prioritize mapping and assessing critical minerals.

#### (4) Inclusions ####

In carrying out paragraph (1), the Initiative shall also—

(A) map and collect data for areas containing mine waste to increase understanding of above-ground critical mineral resources in previously disturbed areas; and

(B) provide for analysis of samples, including samples within the National Geological and Geophysical Data Preservation Program established under section 15908(b) of title 42 for the occurrence of critical minerals.

#### (f) Availability ####

The Initiative shall make the geospatial data and metadata gathered by the Initiative under subsection (e)(1) electronically publicly accessible on an ongoing basis.

#### (g) Integration of data sources ####

The Initiative shall integrate data sources, including data from—

(1) the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program established by section 31c(a)(1) of this title;

(2) the National Geological and Geophysical Data Preservation Program established under section 15908(b) of title 42;

(3) the USMIN Mineral Deposit Database of the United States Geological Survey;

(4) the 3D Elevation Program established under section 3104(a) of this title; and

(5) other relevant sources, including sources providing geothermal resources data.

#### (h) Authorization of appropriations ####

There is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary to carry out this section $320,000,000 for the period of fiscal years 2022 through 2026, to remain available until expended.
