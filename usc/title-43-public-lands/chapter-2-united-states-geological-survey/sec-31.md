"The purpose of this Act is to—

"(1) implement section 323 of the joint resolution entitled 'Joint Resolution making continuing appropriations for the fiscal year 1985, and for other purposes', approved October 12, 1984 (Public Law 98–473; 98 Stat. 1875) [set out below] which supports and encourages the development of a national Continental Scientific Drilling Program;

"(2) enhance fundamental understanding of the composition, structure, dynamics, and evolution of the continental crust, and how such processes affect natural phenomena such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, transfer of geothermal energy, distribution of mineral deposits, the occurrence of fossil fuels, and the nature and extent of aquifers;

"(3) advance basic earth sciences research and technological development;

"(4) obtain critical data regarding the earth's crust relating to isolation of hazardous wastes; and

"(5) develop a long-range plan for implementation of the Continental Scientific Drilling Program.

#### "SEC. 3. FINDINGS. ####

"Congress finds that—

"(1) because the earth provides energy, minerals, and water, and is used as a storage medium for municipal, chemical, and nuclear waste, an understanding of the processes and structures in the earth's crust is essential to the well being of the United States;

"(2) there is a need for developing long-range plans for a United States Continental Scientific Drilling Program; and

"(3) the Continental Scientific Drilling Program would enhance—

"(A) understanding of the crustal evolution of the earth and the mountain building processes;

"(B) understanding of the mechanisms of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions and the development of improved techniques for prediction;

"(C) understanding of the development and utilization of geothermal and other energy sources and the formation of and occurrence of mineral deposits;

"(D) understanding of the migration of fluids in the earth's crust for evaluation of waste contamination and the development of more effective techniques for the safe subsurface disposal of hazardous wastes;

"(E) understanding and definition of the size, source, and more effective use of aquifers and other water resources; and

"(F) evaluation and verification of surface geophysical techniques needed for exploring and monitoring the earth's crust.

#### "SEC. 4. IMPLEMENTATION OF CONTINENTAL SCIENTIFIC DRILLING PROGRAM. ####

"The Secretary of the Department of Energy, the Secretary of the Department of the Interior through the United States Geological Survey, and the Director of the National Science Foundation shall implement the policies of section 323 of the joint resolution entitled 'Joint Resolution making continuing appropriations for the fiscal year 1985, and for other purposes', approved October 12, 1984 (Public Law 98–473; 98 Stat. 1875) [set out below] by—

The Continental Scientific Drilling Program is an important national scientific endeavor that is vital to the understanding of the geologic evolution of the Earth and the economic value of its resources; the most effective and efficient means of realizing the fullest potential in the Continental Scientific Drilling Program is through a cooperative effort by the Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation, and the United States Geological Survey; many important commercial and scientific advances may result from the Continental Scientific Drilling Program; and many foreign nations are engaged in a comparable deep drilling program, and cooperation and coordination would be beneficial to United States efforts. It is the sense of the Congress that—

"(1) the Continental Scientific Drilling Program is an important national scientific endeavor by the United States which should be enthusiastically implemented through a joint cooperative effort among the United States Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation, and the United States Geological Survey;

"(2) the private sector should be encouraged to support the Continental Scientific Drilling Program and the participating agencies should solicit appropriate private sector participation in such program; and

"(3) the United States Government should cooperate to the extent practicable with the international community in developing this important scientific and technical activity."
