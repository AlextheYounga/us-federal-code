#### (a) Considerations ####

The Secretary may consider acreage rental rates, capacity fees, and other recurring annual fees in total when evaluating existing rates paid for the use of Federal land by eligible projects.

#### (b) Reductions in base rental rates ####

The Secretary may reduce acreage rental rates and capacity fees, or both, for existing and new wind and solar authorizations if the Secretary determines—

(A) exceed fair market value;

(B) impose economic hardships;

(C) limit commercial interest in a competitive lease sale or right-of-way grant; or

(D) are not competitively priced compared to other available land; or
