#### (a) In general ####

The Committee shall operate an electronic service that provides access to geospatial data and metadata for geospatial data to the general public, to be known as the GeoPlatform.

(ii) be accessible through a common interface;

(iii) include metadata for all geospatial data collected by covered agencies, directly or indirectly;

(iv) include download access to all open geospatial data directly or indirectly collected by covered agencies; and

(v) include a set of programming instructions and standards providing an automated means of accessing available geospatial data, which—
