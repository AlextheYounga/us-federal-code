"(ii) guidance provided by the Office of Personnel Management; and

"(B) resulting in significant cost to the Federal Government;

"(2) administrative leave should be used sparingly;

"(3) prior to the use of paid leave to address personnel issues, an agency should consider other actions, including—

"(A) temporary reassignment; and

"(A) the employee is returned to duty status; or

"(B) an appropriate personnel action is taken with respect to the employee;

"(5) data show that there are too many examples of employees placed in administrative leave for 6 months or longer, leaving the employees without any available recourse to—

"(6) an agency should ensure accurate and consistent recording of the use of administrative leave so that administrative leave can be managed and overseen effectively; and
