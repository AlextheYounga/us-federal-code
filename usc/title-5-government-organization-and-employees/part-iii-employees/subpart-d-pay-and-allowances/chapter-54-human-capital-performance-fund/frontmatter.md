"(1) which is in the same grade of the General Schedule, and the same agency, as the position which such employee occupied on October 31, 1993; and

"(2) to which the provisions of [former] chapter 54 of title 5, United States Code (as in effect on October 31, 1993) would apply if such provisions had remained in effect.

"(c) Special Rules.—

"(1) In general.—The rate of basic pay for an employee who is subject to this section shall be the rate payable to such employee on October 31, 1993, subject to paragraph (2).

"(2) Adjustments.—Adjustments in the rate of basic pay for an employee who is subject to this section shall be made in accordance with the relevant provisions of title 5, United States Code, or otherwise applicable provisions of law, subject to the following:
