The word "authority" is substituted for "officer" in recognition of the several appointing authorities named in section 2105(a)(1).

In subsection (a), the provisions of former section 633(2)2 are merged in the requirement of former section 857, since the certificate must be of the three highest on the register and the nominating or appointing employee may select one of the three.

In subsection (c), the prohibition in former section 864 is restated in positive form. The words "an individual who qualifies as a preference eligible under section 2108(3)(B)–(F)" are substituted for "ten-point preference eligibles".

Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
