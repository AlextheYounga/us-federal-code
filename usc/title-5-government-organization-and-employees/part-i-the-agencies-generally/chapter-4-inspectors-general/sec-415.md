For definition of "appropriate congressional committees" as seen in the above amendments by Pub. L. 117–263, see Amendments Not Shown in Text note set out under section 401 of this title.

F, title I, §1414, Oct. 5, 2018, 132 Stat. 3492.|

In subsection (a)(1)(A), the words "the Board for International Broadcasting" are omitted as obsolete. The Board for International Broadcasting was established by section 3(a) of the Board for International Broadcasting Act of 1973 (Public Law 93–129, 87 Stat. 457). The Board for International Broadcasting Act of 1973 was repealed by section 310(e) of the United States International Broadcasting Act of 1994 (Public Law 103–236, title III, 108 Stat. 442).

In subsection (a)(1)(A), the words "the Federal Housing Finance Board" are omitted as obsolete because the Federal Housing Finance Board was abolished by section 1311 of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (Public Law 110–289, div. A, title III, 12 U.S.C. 4511 note).

In subsection (a)(1)(A), the words "the Panama Canal Commission" are omitted as obsolete because of section 1305 of the Panama Canal Act of 1979 (22 U.S.C. 3714a).

In subsection (a)(1), subparagraph (B) restates the amendment made by section 409(a) of the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 (Public Law 105–134, 111 Stat. 2586). That provision amended section 8G(a)(2) of the Inspector General Act of 1978 by striking "Amtrak" from the definition of "designated Federal entity". However, the amendment was enacted with a conditional effective date; it will take effect at the beginning of the first fiscal year after a fiscal year for which Amtrak receives no Federal subsidy. The conditional effective date creates uncertainty because it cannot be known in advance when the condition will be met and the amendment will take effect. In subsection (a)(1), subparagraph (B) explicitly incorporates the amendatory language and the conditional effective date within the restatement text in order to clarify that although "Amtrak" is currently included in the definition of "designated Federal entity", it is automatically struck from the definition, without further congressional action, whenever the specified condition is met.

In subsection (f)(3), in subparagraph (A)(iii) and subparagraph (C), the words "[Committee] on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs [of the Senate]" are substituted for "[Committee] on Governmental Affairs [of the Senate]" because of Senate Resolution No. 445, 108th Congress, October 9, 2004 (effective January 4, 2005).

In subsection (f)(3), in subparagraph (A)(iii) and subparagraph (C), the words "Committee on Oversight and Reform" are substituted for "Committee on Government Reform and Oversight" on authority of rule X(1)(n) of the Rules of the House of Representatives, adopted by House Resolution No. 6 (116th Congress, January 9, 2019).

In subsection (f)(3)(B)(ii), the word "ensuring" is substituted for "insuring" for clarity.

In subsection (g)(3), the words "Notwithstanding the last sentence of subsection (d)(1) of this section" are substituted for "Notwithstanding the last sentence of subsection (d) of this section" for clarity and to correct an obsolete reference in the law. In section 8G of the Inspector General Act of 1978, subsection (d) was redesignated as subsection (d)(1) by section 431(c)(1) of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (Public Law 111–259, 124 Stat. 2731).

In subsection (h)(1), the words "Each year," are substituted for "No later than April 30, 1989, and annually thereafter," to eliminate obsolete language.

In subsection (h)(2), the words "On October 31 of each year," are substituted for "Beginning on October 31, 1989, and on October 31 of each succeeding calendar year," to eliminate obsolete language.
