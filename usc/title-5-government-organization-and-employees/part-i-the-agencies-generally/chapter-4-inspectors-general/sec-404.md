#### **Editorial Notes** ####

#### References in Text ####

Paragraph (1), referred to in subsec. (b)(1)(C), means par. (1) of subsec. (b) of this section, but probably should be a reference to subpar. (A) of subsec. (b)(1) of this section. Prior to repeal and restatement as this section, subsec. (b)(1) of the source section had been redesignated as subsec. (b)(1)(A) by Pub. L. 100–504, title I, §109(1), (2), Oct. 18, 1988, 102 Stat. 2529, with no conforming amendment to the reference, and the restated text carried over such reference without change.
