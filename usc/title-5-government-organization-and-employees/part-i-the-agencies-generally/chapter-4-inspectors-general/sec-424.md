In subsection (b)(1)(I), the words "Government Publishing Office" are substituted for "Government Printing Office" because of section 1301(b) of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2015 (Public Law 113–235, div. H, 44 U.S.C. note prec. 301).

In subsection (b)(3)(B)(viii)(IV), the words "Committee on Oversight and Reform" are substituted for "Committee on Oversight and Government Reform" on authority of rule X(1)(n) of the Rules of the House of Representatives, adopted by House Resolution No. 6 (116th Congress, January 9, 2019).

In subsection (c)(1)(H), the words "section 103H of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3033)" are substituted for "section 3033 of title 50, United States Code" to correct the citation.

In subsection (c)(3)(C), the date "October 14, 2008" is substituted for "the date of enactment of this subsection" to reflect the date of enactment of the Inspector General Reform Act of 2008 (Public Law 110–409, 122 Stat. 4302). Section 7(a) of the Inspector General Reform Act of 2008 (Public Law 110–409, 122 Stat. 4305) enacted section 11 (including subsection (c)) of the Inspector General Act of 1978.

In subsection (c)(3)(C), the words "the authority in that subparagraph" are substituted for "the authority in that paragraph" to correct an error in the law.

In subsection (c)(5)(A), the reference to "section 403(d)(1)(C) of this title" is substituted for "section 3(d)(C)" for clarity and to correct an error in the law. In section 11(c)(5)(A) of the Inspector General Act of 1978, as added by section 2(b) of the Whistleblower Protection Coordination Act (Public Law 115–192, 132 Stat. 1503), the reference to "section 3(d)(C)" should be to "section 3(d)(1)(C)". Section 3(d)(1)(C) of the Inspector General Act of 1978 is restated as "section 403(d)(1)(C) of this title" (i.e., section 403(d)(1)(C) of title 5, United States Code).

In subsection (d)(8)(A), at the end of clause (ii), the word "and" is omitted to correct an error in the law.

In subsection (d)(8)(A)(iii), the words "Committee on Oversight and Reform" are substituted for "Committee on Oversight and Government Reform" on authority of rule X(1)(n) of the Rules of the House of Representatives, adopted by House Resolution No. 6 (116th Congress, January 9, 2019).

In subsection (e)(1)(C), the word "Program" is substituted for the word "Plan" (in the phrase "Troubled Asset Relief *Program*") to correct an error in the law. In subsection (e)(1)(D), the words "Coronavirus Economic Stabilization Act of 2020" are substituted for "CARES Act" to use the applicable short title as provided in section 4001 of Public Law 116–136 (134 Stat. 469).

In subsection (e), paragraph (4) is added to carry forward the effective date provision from section 501(c) of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (Public Law 116–260, div. U, title V, 134 Stat. 2294). Section 501(c) of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 provides that: "This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall take effect on the date that is 30 days after the date of receipt by the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency of an appropriation for the implementation of this Act.". The scope of applicability for the effective date provision is unclear because the references to *this Act* are ambiguous. The references to *this Act* do not refer the entirety of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, because the references are limited by section 3 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (Public Law 116–260, 134 Stat. 1185), which provides that: "Except as expressly provided otherwise, any reference to 'this Act' contained in any division of this Act shall be treated as referring only to the provisions of that division.". At most, therefore, the references to this Act refer only to the provisions of division U of the Act (beginning at 134 Stat. 2286). However, it is questionable whether Congress intends the effective date to apply to the entirety of division U. The relevant portion of division U appears to be limited to section 501 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021. The effective date is clearly intended to apply to section 501 of the Act, but it is unclear whether it is intended to apply to other portions of division U. In the restatement, paragraph (4) of subsection (e) carries forward the effective date as a "no-source" provision, explicitly making the effective date apply to the provisions added by section 501 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, while avoiding the repeal of section 501(c) of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, which continues to apply (or not) to other portions of division U to whatever extent Congress originally intended.
