In paragraph (1), the words "Veterans Affairs" are inserted in the list of Departments, and the words "Veterans' Administration" are deleted from the list of Administrations, to update obsolete references in the law.

In paragraph (1), the words "the Resolution Trust Corporation" have been omitted as obsolete because section 21A(m)(1) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1441a(m)(1)) provided for termination of the Resolution Trust Corporation not later than December 31, 1995, and the authority and responsibilities of the Resolution Trust Corporation were transferred to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under section 40(n)(4) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831q(n)(4)).

In paragraphs (1) and (3), the words "of the United States" are inserted after "Export-Import Bank" to correct errors in the law.

In paragraph (3), the words "the Director of" are inserted before "the Office of Personnel Management" to correct an error in the law. The Office of Personnel Management is headed by a director (rather than an administrator) as provided in section 1102(a) of title 5, United States Code.

In paragraph (3), the words "the Chairperson of the Thrift Depositor Protection Oversight Board" are omitted because the Thrift Depositor Protection Oversight Board was abolished by section 14(a) through (d) of the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998 (Public Law 105–216, 112 Stat. 908).

In paragraph (3), the words "the chief executive officer of the Resolution Trust Corporation" are omitted because section 21A(m)(1) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1441a(m)(1)) provided for termination of the Resolution Trust Corporation not later than December 31, 1995, and the authority and responsibilities of the Resolution Trust Corporation were transferred to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under section 40(n)(4) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831q(n)(4)).
