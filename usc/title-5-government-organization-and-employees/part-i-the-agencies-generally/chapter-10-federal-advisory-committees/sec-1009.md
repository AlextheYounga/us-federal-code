### §1009. Advisory committee procedures ###

(a) Committee Meetings.—

(1) Open to public.—Each advisory committee meeting shall be open to the public.

(2) Notice of meetings.—Except when the President determines otherwise for reasons of national security, timely notice of each meeting shall be published in the Federal Register, and the Administrator shall prescribe regulations to provide for other types of public notice to insure that all interested persons are notified of each meeting in advance.

(3) Participation.—Interested persons shall be permitted to attend, appear before, or file statements with any advisory committee, subject to such reasonable rules or regulations as the Administrator may prescribe.

(b) Public Inspection and Copying of Records.—Subject to section 552 of this title, the records, reports, transcripts, minutes, appendixes, working papers, drafts, studies, agenda, or other documents which were made available to or prepared for or by each advisory committee shall be available for public inspection and copying at a single location in the offices of the advisory committee or the agency to which the advisory committee reports until the advisory committee ceases to exist.

(c) Minutes.—Detailed minutes of each meeting of each advisory committee shall be kept and shall contain a record of the persons present, a complete and accurate description of matters discussed and conclusions reached, and copies of all reports received, issued, or approved by the advisory committee. The accuracy of all minutes shall be certified by the chairman of the advisory committee.

(d) Closed Sessions.—Paragraphs (1) and (3) of subsection (a) shall not apply to any portion of an advisory committee meeting for which the President, or the head of the agency to which the advisory committee reports, determines that such portion of the meeting may be closed to the public in accordance with section 552b(c) of this title. Any such determination shall be in writing and shall contain the reasons for the determination. If such a determination is made, the advisory committee shall issue a report, at least annually, setting forth a summary of its activities and such related matters as would be informative to the public consistent with the policy of section 552(b) of this title.

(e) Designated Officer or Employee of Federal Government.—There shall be designated an officer or employee of the Federal Government to chair or attend each meeting of each advisory committee. The officer or employee so designated is authorized, whenever the officer or employee determines it to be in the public interest, to adjourn any such meeting. An advisory committee shall not conduct any meeting in the absence of that designated officer or employee of the Federal Government.

(f) Call for Meeting or Advance Approval.—Advisory committees shall not hold any meetings except at the call of, or with the advance approval of, a designated officer or employee of the Federal Government, and in the case of advisory committees (other than Presidential advisory committees), with an agenda approved by such officer or employee.

In subsection (a), in paragraphs (2) and (3), the word "Administrator" is substituted for "Director" (meaning the Director of the Office of Management and Budget) because of section 5F of Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1977 (5 U.S.C. App.).
