In subsection (b)(1), the reference to "subchapter I" is substituted for "title II of this Act" for clarity and to update an obsolete reference in the law. The reference to "title II of this Act" means title II of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, which was previously repealed. Section 201 of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 (Public Law 101–194, 103 Stat. 1724) repealed title II of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978. Section 202 of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 (Public Law 101–194, 103 Stat. 1724) enacted a general amendment of title I of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, and, as amended, title I of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 included provisions relating to the filing, review, and public availability of financial statements filed by officers and employees in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the Federal Government. Title I of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 is restated as "subchapter I" (i.e., subchapter I of chapter 131 of title 5, United States Code).

In subsection (b)(3), the reference to "subchapter I" is substituted for "title II of this Act" and for "such title" for clarity and to update obsolete references in the law. See the explanation in the revision note pertaining to subsection (b)(1) of this section.

In subsection (b)(15), the reference to "subchapter I" is substituted for "title II of this Act" for clarity and to update an obsolete reference in the law. See the explanation in the revision note pertaining to subsection (b)(1) of this section.

In subsection (f)(2)(B)(iv), the reference to "subchapter I" is substituted for "title 2 of this Act" for clarity and to update an erroneous and obsolete reference in the law. The reference to "title 2 of this Act" should be "title II of this Act", meaning title II of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, which was previously repealed. See the explanation in the revision note pertaining to subsection (b)(1) of this section.

In subsection (f)(2)(B)(iv), the reference to "section 13108 of this title" is substituted for "section 206 of this Act" for clarity and to update an obsolete reference in the law. The reference to "section 206 of this Act" means section 206 of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, which was previously repealed. The Act language for the now repealed section 206 of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 appears at 92 Stat. 1847 (except that section 9(m) of Public Law 96–19 (93 Stat. 43) amended the text of section 206(a) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 by striking "shall be" and inserting "is"). Section 206 of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 was repealed by section 201 of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 (Public Law 101–194, 103 Stat. 1724), and equivalent language was enacted as section 106 of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 by section 202 of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 (Public Law 101–194, 103 Stat. 1724, 1739). Section 106 of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 is restated as "section 13108 of this title" (i.e., section 13108 of title 5, United States Code).

In subsection (f)(3)(B), the words "the head of the officer's" are substituted for "the head of officer's" to correct an error in the law.
