|          13104           |5 U.S.C. App. (EGA §102)|Pub. L. 95–521, title I, §102, Oct. 26, 1978, 92 Stat. 1825; Pub. L. 96–19, §§3(a)(1), (b), 6(a), 7(a)–(d)(1), (f), 9(b), (c)(1), (j), June 13, 1979, 93 Stat. 39–43; Pub. L. 97–51, §130(b), Oct. 1, 1981, 95 Stat. 966; Pub. L. 98–150, §10, Nov. 11, 1983, 97 Stat. 962; Pub. L. 101–194, title II, §202, Nov. 30, 1989, 103 Stat. 1727; Pub. L. 101–280, §3(3), May 4, 1990, 104 Stat. 152; Pub. L. 102–90, title III, §314(a), Aug. 14, 1991, 105 Stat. 469; Pub. L. 104–65, §§20, 22(a), (b), Dec. 19, 1995, 109 Stat. 704, 705; Pub. L. 112–105, §13(a), Apr. 4, 2012, 126 Stat. 300.|

In subsection (a)(4)(A), in clause (ii)(II) and clause (iii)(II), the words "special Government employee" are substituted for "special government employee" to correct errors in the law.

In subsection (f)(2)(B)(ii), at the end of the clause, after the word "knowledge", the word "of" is omitted to correct an error in the law. The preceding phrase "of which" eliminates the need for "of" after "knowledge".

In subsection (f)(3)(E), the words "Securities Exchange Act of 1934" are substituted for "Securities and Exchange Act of 1934" to correct an error in the law. See the short title enacted by section 1 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78a).

In subsection (f)(3)(F), the reference to "the effective date of title II of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989" is not translated to a date certain because the date varies. For most provisions, the effective date is January 1, 1991. For section 102(f)(4)(B) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, which is restated as section 13104(f)(4)(B) of title 5, United States Code, the effective date is January 1, 1990. See section 204 of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, as added by section 3(10)(B) of Public Law 101–280 (104 Stat. 157).

In subsection (f)(4)(B)(i)(V), the reference to "the effective date of this Act" is not translated to a date certain because the date is ambiguous. The words "the effective date of this Act" probably mean the effective date of title II of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 (rather than the effective date of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978). Title II of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 enacted a general amendment of title I of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (see section 202 at 103 Stat. 1724). For title II of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, the effective date varies. For most provisions, the effective date is January 1, 1991. For section 102(f)(4)(B) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, which is restated as section 13104(f)(4)(B) of title 5, United States Code, the effective date is January 1, 1990. See section 204 of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, as added by section 3(10)(B) of Public Law 101–280 (104 Stat. 157).
