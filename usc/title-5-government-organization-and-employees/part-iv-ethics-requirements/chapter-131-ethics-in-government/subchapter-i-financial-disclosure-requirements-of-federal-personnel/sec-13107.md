(1) this section does not require public availability of a report filed by any individual in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, or the National Security Agency, or any individual engaged in intelligence activities in any agency of the United States, if the President finds or has found that, due to the nature of the office or position occupied by such individual, public disclosure of such report would, by revealing the identity of the individual or other sensitive information, compromise the national interest of the United States; and such individuals may be authorized, notwithstanding section 13106(a) of this title, to file such additional reports as are necessary to protect their identity from public disclosure if the President first finds or has found that such filing is necessary in the national interest; and

(2) Public availability.—Such report shall be made available to the public—

(A) in the case of a Member of Congress, until a date that is 6 years from the date the individual ceases to be a Member of Congress; and

(Pub. L. 117–286, §3(c), Dec. 27, 2022, 136 Stat. 4289.)

#### Amendments Not Shown in Text ####

This section was derived from section 105 of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, Pub. L. 95–521, which was set out in the former Appendix to this title, and as it existed as of Oct. 19, 2021. Section 105 of Pub. L. 95–521 was amended by Pub. L. 117–125, §2(b), (c)(2), May 13, 2022, 136 Stat. 1205, 1206, prior to being repealed and reenacted as this section by Pub. L. 117–286, §§3(c), 7, Dec. 27, 2022, 136 Stat. 4289, 4361. For applicability of those amendments to this section, see section 5(b) of Pub. L. 117–286, set out in a Transitional and Savings Provisions note preceding section 101 of this title. Section 105 of Pub. L. 95–521 was amended as follows:

(1) in subsection (a)(1), by striking "be revealing" and inserting "by revealing";

(2) in subsection (b)—

(A) in paragraph (1), in the first sentence, by striking "be,," and inserting "be," and, in the third sentence, by striking "may be may" and inserting "may be, may"; and

(B) in paragraph (3)(A), by striking "described in section 109(8) or 109(10) of this Act" and inserting "who is a judicial officer or a judicial employee"; and

(3) by redesignating subsections (c) and (d) as (d) and (e), respectively, and by inserting after subsection (b) the following:

*"(c) *ONLINE PUBLICATION OF FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE REPORTS OF FEDERAL JUDGES.—**

*"(1) *ESTABLISHMENT OF DATABASE**.—*Subject to paragraph (4), not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of the Courthouse Ethics and Transparency Act, the Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall establish a searchable internet database to enable public access to any report required to be filed under this title by a judicial officer, bankruptcy judge, or magistrate judge.*

*"(2) *AVAILABILITY**.—*Not later than 90 days after the date on which a report is required to be filed under this title by a judicial officer, bankruptcy judge, or magistrate judge, the Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall make the report available on the database established under paragraph (1) in a full-text searchable, sortable, and downloadable format for access by the public.*

*"(3) *REDACTION**.—*Any report made available on the database established under paragraph (1) shall not contain any information that is redacted in accordance with subsection (b)(3).*

*"(4) *ADDITIONAL TIME.—**

*"(A) *IN GENERAL**.—*Subject to subparagraph (B), the requirements of this subsection may be implemented after the date described in paragraph (1) if the Administrative Office of the United States Courts identifies in writing to the relevant committees of Congress the additional time needed for that implementation.*

*"(B) *PUBLICATION REQUIREMENT**.—*The Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall continue to make the reports described in paragraph (1) available to the public during the period in which the Administrative Office of the United States Courts establishes the database under this subsection."*

The substitutions directed to subsections (a)(1) and (b)(1) had already been made in the text of this section as restated by Pub. L. 117–286. The reference to "section 109(8) or 109(10) of this Act" in the quoted text directed to be stricken in subsection (b)(3)(A) did not appear in the text as enacted by Pub. L. 117–286 but was changed to refer to "paragraph (9) or (10) of section 13101 of this title".

The date of enactment of the Courthouse Ethics and Transparency Act, referred to in subsection (c)(1) as set out above, is the date of enactment of Pub. L. 117–125, which was approved May 13, 2022.

In subsection (a)(1), the word "by" is substituted for "be" to correct an error in the law. The change appears in the phrase "public disclosure of such report would, by [be] revealing the identity of the individual or other sensitive information, compromise the national interest of the United States".

In subsection (b)(3)(C) (matter before clause (i)), the words "Committee on Oversight and Reform" are substituted for "Committee on Oversight and Government Reform" on authority of Rule X(1)(n) of the Rules of the House of Representatives, adopted by House Resolution No. 6 (116th Congress, January 9, 2019).
