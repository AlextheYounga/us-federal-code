#### Amendments Not Shown in Text ####

This section was derived from section 103 of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, Pub. L. 95–521, which was set out in the former Appendix to this title, and as it existed as of Oct. 19, 2021.

In subsection (h)(1)(A)(ii), the date "November 30, 1989" is substituted for "the date of the enactment of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989" to reflect the date of enactment of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 (Public Law 101–194, 103 Stat. 1716).

In subsection (i)(1), the reference to "section 312(a) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (52 U.S.C. 30113(a))" is substituted for "section 316(a) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971" to correct an error in the law. Section 312(a), not section 316(a), of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 contains provisions relating to the filing of copies of reports with the appropriate State officer. Section 312 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 was originally enacted as section 309, but was redesignated several times. The provision was redesignated as section 317 by section 208(a) of Public Law 93–443 (88 Stat. 1279), as section 316 by section 105 of Public Law 94–283 (90 Stat. 481), and as section 312 by section 105(4) of Public Law 96–187 (93 Stat. 1354).

In subsection (j)(1), the words "Committee on Ethics of the House of Representatives" are substituted for "Committee on Standards of Official Conduct of the House of Representatives" because of House Resolution No. 5, 112th Congress, January 5, 2011.

In subsection (l)(8), the words "special Government employee as defined in section 202 of title 18" are substituted for "special government employee" for clarity and consistency with other provisions of the chapter.
