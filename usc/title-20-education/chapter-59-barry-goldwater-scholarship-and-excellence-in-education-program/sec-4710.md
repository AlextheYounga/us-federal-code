#### **Editorial Notes** ####

#### References in Text ####

Section 4709 of this title, referred to in subsec. (a)(1), was a reference to section 4709 in the original but probably should have been a reference to section 1410 of the Barry Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education Act, Pub. L. 99–661, div. A, title XIV, which is classified to section 4709 of this title.

Level IV of the Executive Schedule, referred to in subsec. (a)(2), is set out in section 5315 of Title 5, Government Organization and Employees.
