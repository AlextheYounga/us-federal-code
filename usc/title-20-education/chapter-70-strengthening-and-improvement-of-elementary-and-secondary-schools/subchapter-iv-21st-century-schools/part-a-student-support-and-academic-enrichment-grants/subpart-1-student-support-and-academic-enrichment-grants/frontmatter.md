#### Codification ####

Subpart 1 of part A of title IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, comprising this subpart, was originally added to Pub. L. 89–10, title IV, by Pub. L. 107–110, title IV, §401, Jan. 8, 2002, 115 Stat. 1735. Subpart 1 is shown herein, however, as having been added by Pub. L. 114–95, title IV, §4101, Dec. 10, 2015, 129 Stat. 1968, without reference to those intervening amendments because of the extensive revision of subpart 1 by Pub. L. 114–95.
