#### **Editorial Notes** ####

#### References in Text ####

Section 7115(a) of this title, referred to in subsec. (a), was in the original "section 4015(a)", and was translated as meaning section 4105(a) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, Pub. L. 89–10, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because that Act does not contain a section 4015 and section 4105(a) refers to allocations.
