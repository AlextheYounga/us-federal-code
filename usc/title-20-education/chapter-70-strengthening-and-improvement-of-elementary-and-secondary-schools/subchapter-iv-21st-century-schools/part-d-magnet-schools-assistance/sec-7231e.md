### §7231e. Priority ###

(2) propose to—

(A) carry out a new, evidence-based magnet school program;

(B) significantly revise an existing magnet school program, using evidence-based methods and practices, as available; or

(C) replicate an existing magnet school program that has a demonstrated record of success in increasing student academic achievement and reducing isolation of minority groups;

(3) propose to select students to attend magnet school programs by methods such as lottery, rather than through academic examination; and
