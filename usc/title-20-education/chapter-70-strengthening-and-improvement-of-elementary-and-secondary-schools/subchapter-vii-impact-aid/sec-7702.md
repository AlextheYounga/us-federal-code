#### (a) In general ####

Where the Secretary, after consultation with any local educational agency and with the appropriate State educational agency, determines—

(A) has been acquired by the United States since 1938;

(B) was not acquired by exchange for other Federal property in the local educational agency which the United States owned before 1939; and

(C) had an assessed value according to original records (including facsimiles or other reproductions of those records) documenting the assessed value of such property (determined as of the time or times when so acquired) prepared by the local officials referred to in subsection (b)(3) or, when such original records are not available due to unintentional destruction (such as natural disaster, fire, flooding, pest infestation, or deterioration due to age), other records, including Federal agency records, local historical records, or other records that the Secretary determines to be appropriate and reliable, aggregating 10 percent or more of the assessed value of—

(i) all real property in the local educational agency (similarly determined as of the time or times when such Federal property was so acquired); or

(ii) all real property in the local educational agency as assessed in the first year preceding or succeeding acquisition, whichever is greater, only if—

(I) the assessment of all real property in the local educational agency is not made at the same time or times that such Federal property was so acquired and assessed; and

(II) State law requires an assessment be made of property so acquired; and

(2) that such agency is not being substantially compensated for the loss in revenue resulting from such ownership by increases in revenue accruing to the agency from the conduct of Federal activities with respect to such Federal property,

then such agency shall be eligible to receive the amount described in subsection (b) or (h) of this section.

#### (b) Amount ####

#### (1) In general ####

(A)(i)(I) Subject to subclauses (II) and (III), the amount that a local educational agency shall be paid under subsection (a) of this section for a fiscal year shall be calculated in accordance with paragraph (2).

(II) Except as provided in subclause (III), the Secretary may not reduce the amount of a payment under this section to a local educational agency for a fiscal year by (aa) the amount equal to the amount of revenue, if any, the agency received during the previous fiscal year from activities conducted on Federal property eligible under this section and located in a school district served by the agency, including amounts received from any Federal department or agency (other than the Department of Education) from such activities, by reason of receipt of such revenue, or (bb) any other amount by reason of receipt of such revenue.

(III) If the amount equal to the sum of (aa) the proposed payment under this section to a local educational agency for a fiscal year and (bb) the amount of revenue described in subclause (II)(aa) received by the agency during the previous fiscal year, exceeds the maximum amount the agency is eligible to receive under this section for the fiscal year involved, then the Secretary shall reduce the amount of the proposed payment under this section by an amount equal to such excess amount.

(ii) For purposes of clause (i), the amount of revenue that a local educational agency receives during the previous fiscal year from activities conducted on Federal property shall not include payments received by the agency from the Secretary of Defense to support—

(I) the operation of a domestic dependent elementary or secondary school; or

(II) the provision of a free public education to dependents of members of the Armed Forces residing on or near a military installation.

(B) If funds appropriated under section 7714(a) of this title are insufficient to pay the amount determined under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall calculate the payment for each eligible local educational agency in accordance with subsection (h) of this section.

(C) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, a local educational agency may not be paid an amount under this section that, when added to the amount such agency receives under section 7703(b) of this title, exceeds the maximum amount that such agency is eligible to receive for such fiscal year under section 7703(b)(1)(C) of this title, or the maximum amount that such agency is eligible to receive for such fiscal year under this section, whichever is greater.

#### (2) Application of current levied real property tax rate ####

In calculating the amount that a local educational agency is eligible to receive for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall apply the current levied real property tax rate for current expenditures levied by fiscally independent local educational agencies, or imputed for fiscally dependent local educational agencies, to the current annually determined estimated taxable value of such acquired Federal property.

#### (3) Determination of taxable value for eligible Federal property ####

#### (A) In general ####

In determining the estimated taxable value of such acquired Federal property for fiscal year 2010 and each succeeding fiscal year, the Secretary shall—

(i) first determine the total taxable value for the purpose of levying property tax for school purposes for current expenditures of real property located within the boundaries of such local educational agency;

(ii) then determine the per acre value of the eligible Federal property by dividing the total taxable value as determined in clause (i) by the difference between the total acres located within the boundaries of the local educational agency and the number of Federal acres eligible under this section; and

(iii) then determine the total taxable value of the eligible Federal property by multiplying the per acre value as calculated under clause (ii) by the number of Federal acres eligible under this section.

#### (B) Special rule ####

In the case of Federal property eligible under this section that is within the boundaries of 2 or more local educational agencies that are eligible under this section, any of such agencies may ask the Secretary to calculate (and the Secretary shall calculate) the taxable value of the eligible Federal property that is within its boundaries by—

(i) first calculating the per-acre value of the eligible Federal property separately for each eligible local educational agency that shared the Federal property, as provided in subparagraph (A)(ii);

(ii) then averaging the resulting per-acre values of the eligible Federal property from each eligible local educational agency that shares the Federal property; and

(iii) then applying the average per-acre value to determine the total taxable value of the eligible Federal property under subparagraph (A)(iii) for the requesting local educational agency.

#### (c) Applicability to Tennessee Valley Authority Act ####

#### (d) Ownership by United States ####

The United States shall be deemed to own Federal property for the purposes of this chapter, where—

(2) the United States transfers a portion of the property referred to in paragraph (1) to another nontaxable entity, and the United States—

#### (ii) Exception ####

In calculating such average payment for a local educational agency that did not receive a payment under subsection (b) for 1 or more of the fiscal years between fiscal year 2006 and 2009, inclusive, the lowest such payment made to the agency for fiscal year 2006, 2007, 2008, or 2009, shall be treated as the payment that the agency received under subsection (b) for each fiscal year for which the agency did not receive such a payment.

#### (C) Insufficient appropriations ####
