#### (a) In general ####

To ensure timely and meaningful consultation on issues affecting American Indian and Alaska Native students, an affected local educational agency shall consult with appropriate officials from Indian tribes or tribal organizations approved by the tribes located in the area served by the local educational agency prior to the affected local educational agency's submission of a required plan or application for a covered program under this chapter or for a program under subchapter VI of this chapter. Such consultation shall be done in a manner and in such time that provides the opportunity for such appropriate officials from Indian tribes or tribal organizations to meaningfully and substantively contribute to such plan.

#### (b) Documentation ####

Each affected local educational agency shall maintain in the agency's records and provide to the State educational agency a written affirmation signed by the appropriate officials of the participating tribes or tribal organizations approved by the tribes that the consultation required by this section has occurred.
