(2) if the child or youth is identified as in need of special education services while in the correctional facility, notify the local school of the child or youth of such need;

(3) where feasible, provide transition assistance to help the child or youth stay in school, including coordination of services for the family, counseling, assistance in accessing drug and alcohol abuse prevention programs, tutoring, and family counseling;

(5) work to ensure that the correctional facility is staffed with teachers and other qualified staff who are trained to work with children and youth with disabilities taking into consideration the unique needs of such children and youth;

(7) to the extent possible, use technology to assist in coordinating educational programs between the correctional facility and the community school;

(8) where feasible, involve parents in efforts to improve the educational achievement of their children and prevent the further involvement of such children in delinquent activities;

(13) consult with the local educational agency for a period jointly determined necessary by the correctional facility and local educational agency upon discharge from that facility, to coordinate educational services so as to minimize disruption to the child's or youth's achievement.
