(B) with respect to any amounts remaining after the allocation under subparagraph (A), an amount that bears the same relationship to such total remaining amounts as the number of students aged 5 through 17 in the State (as determined by the Secretary on the basis of the most recent satisfactory data) bears to the total number of such students in all States.

#### (b) Amounts above trigger amount ####

For any fiscal year for which the amount made available for a fiscal year under subsection <sup><a href="#6363_1_target" name="6363_1">1</a></sup> 6302(b) of this title exceeds the amount described in section 6311(b)(2)(I) of this title, the Secretary shall make such excess amount available as follows:

#### (B) Applications ####

A State, or a consortium of States, that desires a competitive grant under subparagraph (A) shall submit an application to the Secretary at such time and in such manner as the Secretary may reasonably require. The application shall demonstrate that the requirements of this section will be met for the uses of funds described under subparagraph (A).

#### (C) Amount of competitive grants ####

In determining the amount of a grant under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall ensure that a State or consortium's grant, as the case may be, shall include an amount that bears the same relationship to the total funds available to carry out this subsection for the fiscal year as the number of students aged 5 through 17 in the State, or, in the case of a consortium, in each State that comprises the consortium, (as determined by the Secretary on the basis of the most recent satisfactory data) bears to the total number of such students in all States.

#### (2) Allotments ####

Any amounts remaining after the Secretary awards funds under paragraph (1) shall be allotted to each State, or consortium of States, that did not receive a grant under such paragraph, in an amount that bears the same relationship to the remaining amounts as the number of students aged 5 through 17 in the State, or, in the case of a consortium, in the States of the consortium, (as determined by the Secretary on the basis of the most recent satisfactory data) bears to the total number of such students in all States.

#### (c) State defined ####
