#### (c) Alternative process for certain exceptions ####

If consensus, as defined in section 562 of title 5, on any proposed regulation is not reached by the individuals selected under subsection (b)(3)(B) for the negotiated rulemaking process, or if the Secretary determines that a negotiated rulemaking process is unnecessary, the Secretary may propose a regulation in the following manner:

#### (2) Comment period for Congress ####

The Secretary shall—

(A) before issuing any notice of proposed rulemaking under this subsection, provide Congress with a comment period of 15 business days to make comments on the proposed regulation, beginning on the date that the Secretary provides the notice of intent to the appropriate committees of Congress under paragraph (1); and

(B) include and seek to address all comments submitted by Congress in the public rulemaking record for the regulation published in the Federal Register.

#### (3) Comment and review period; emergency situations ####
