### §1068c. Cooperative arrangements ###

#### (a) General authority ####

The Secretary may make grants to encourage cooperative arrangements—

for the activities described in section 1057(b) of this title or section 1062 of this title, as the case may be, so that the resources of the cooperating institutions might be combined and shared to achieve the purposes of such parts and avoid costly duplicative efforts and to enhance the development of part A and part B eligible institutions.

The Secretary shall give priority to grants for the purposes described under subsection (a) whenever the Secretary determines that the cooperative arrangement is geographically and economically sound or will benefit the applicant institution.
