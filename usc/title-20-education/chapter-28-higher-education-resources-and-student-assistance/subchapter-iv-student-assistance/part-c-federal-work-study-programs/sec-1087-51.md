#### Prior Provisions ####

A prior section 441 of Pub. L. 89–329, title IV, formerly Pub. L. 88–452, title I, §141, formerly §121, Aug. 20, 1964, 78 Stat. 513; Pub. L. 89–329, title IV, §441(2), Nov. 8, 1965, 79 Stat. 1249; renumbered §141, Pub. L. 90–222, title I, §111(a), Dec. 23, 1967, 81 Stat. 726; renumbered Pub. L. 89–329, title IV, §441, and amended Pub. L. 90–575, title I, §§131(a), (b)(1), 132, 133(a), Oct. 16, 1968, 82 Stat. 1028, 1029; Pub. L. 91–95, §5, Oct. 22, 1969, 83 Stat. 143; Pub. L. 92–318, title I, §§135, 135A(a), June 23, 1972, 86 Stat. 270; Pub. L. 94–482, title I, §128(a), Oct. 12, 1976, 90 Stat. 2143; Pub. L. 96–374, title IV, §431, Oct. 3, 1980, 94 Stat. 1433, stated purpose of this part and authorized appropriations for fiscal years 1981 to 1985, prior to the general revision of this part by Pub. L. 99–498.

Another prior section 441 of Pub. L. 89–329, title IV, Nov. 8, 1965, 79 Stat. 1249, which amended this section and former sections 2752 to 2756 and 2761 of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare, was repealed by Pub. L. 90–575, title I, §131(a), Oct. 16, 1968, 82 Stat. 1028. Because the repeal happened in order to accommodate the new section 441 resulting from the renumbering of former section 141 of Pub. L. 88–452, the amendments made by prior section 441 were not treated as being struck out.
