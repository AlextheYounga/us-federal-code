The Secretary shall consult, as appropriate, with the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance established under section 1098 of this title on the design, implementation, and evaluation of the demonstration program.

#### (f) Reduction of income and asset information to determine eligibility for student financial aid ####

#### (1) Continuation of current FAFSA simplification efforts ####

The Secretary shall continue to examine—

(A) how the Internal Revenue Service can provide to the Secretary income and other data needed to compute an expected family contribution for taxpayers and dependents of taxpayers, and when in the application cycle the data can be made available;

(B) whether data provided by the Internal Revenue Service can be used to—

(i) prepopulate the electronic version of the FAFSA with student and parent taxpayer data; or

(ii) generate an expected family contribution without additional action on the part of the student and taxpayer; and

(C) whether the data elements collected on the FAFSA that are needed to determine eligibility for student aid, or to administer the Federal student financial aid programs under this subchapter, but are not needed to compute an expected family contribution, such as information regarding the student's citizenship or permanent residency status, registration for selective service, or driver's license number, can be reduced without adverse effects.

#### (2) Report on FAFSA simplification efforts to date ####

Not later than 90 days after August 14, 2008, the Secretary shall provide a written report to the authorizing committees on the work the Department has done with the Secretary of the Treasury regarding—

(A) how the expected family contribution of a student can be calculated using substantially less income and asset information than was used on March 31, 2008;

(B) the extent to which the reduced income and asset information will result in a redistribution of Federal grants and subsidized loans under this subchapter, State aid, or institutional aid, or in a change in the composition of the group of recipients of such aid, and the amount of such redistribution;

(C) how the alternative approaches for calculating the expected family contribution will—

(i) rely mainly, in the case of students and parents who file income tax returns, on information available on the 1040, 1040EZ, and 1040A; and

(ii) include formulas for adjusting income or asset information to produce similar results to the existing approach with less data;

(D) how the Internal Revenue Service can provide to the Secretary of Education income and other data needed to compute an expected family contribution for taxpayers and dependents of taxpayers, and when in the application cycle the data can be made available;

(E) whether data provided by the Internal Revenue Service can be used to—

(i) prepopulate the electronic version of the FAFSA with student and parent taxpayer data; or

(ii) generate an expected family contribution without additional action on the part of the student and taxpayer;

(F) the extent to which the use of income data from two years prior to a student's planned enrollment date will change the expected family contribution computed in accordance with part F, and potential adjustments to the need analysis formula that will minimize the change; and

(G) the extent to which the data elements collected on the FAFSA on March 31, 2008, that are needed to determine eligibility for student aid or to administer the Federal student financial aid programs, but are not needed to compute an expected family contribution, such as information regarding the student's citizenship or permanent residency status, registration for selective service, or driver's license number, can be reduced without adverse effects.

#### (3) Study ####

#### (A) Formation of study group ####

Not later than 90 days after August 14, 2008, the Comptroller General shall convene a study group the membership of which shall include the Secretary of Education, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, representatives of institutions of higher education with expertise in Federal and State financial aid assistance, State chief executive officers of higher education with a demonstrated commitment to simplifying the FAFSA, and such other individuals as the Comptroller General and the Secretary of Education may designate.

#### (B) Study required ####

The Comptroller General, in consultation with the study group convened under subparagraph (A) shall—

(i) review and build on the work of the Secretary of Education and the Secretary of the Treasury, and individuals with expertise in analysis of financial need, to assess alternative approaches for calculating the expected family contribution under the statutory need analysis formula in effect on the day before August 14, 2008, and under a new calculation that will use substantially less income and asset information than was used for the 2008–2009 FAFSA;

(ii) conduct an additional analysis if necessary; and

(iii) make recommendations to the authorizing committees.

#### (C) Objectives of study ####

The objectives of the study required under subparagraph (B) are—

(i) to determine methods to shorten the FAFSA and make the FAFSA easier and less time-consuming to complete, thereby increasing higher education access for low-income students;

(ii) to identify changes to the statutory need analysis formula that will be necessary to reduce the amount of financial information students and families need to provide to receive a determination of eligibility for student financial aid without causing significant redistribution of Federal grants and subsidized loans under this subchapter; and

(iii) to review State and institutional needs and uses for data collected on the FAFSA, and to determine the best means of addressing such needs in the case of modification of the FAFSA as described in clause (i), or modification of the need analysis formula as described in clause (ii).

#### (D) Required subjects of study ####

The study required under subparagraph (B) shall examine—

(i) with respect to simplification of the financial aid application process using the statutory requirements for need analysis—

(I) additional steps that can be taken to simplify the financial aid application process for students who (or, in the case of dependent students, whose parents) are not required to file a Federal income tax return for the prior taxable year;

(II) information on State use of information provided on the FAFSA, including—

(aa) whether a State uses, as of the time of the study, or can use, a student's expected family contribution based on data from two years prior to the student's planned enrollment date;

(bb) the extent to which States and institutions will accept the data provided by the Internal Revenue Service to prepopulate the electronic version of the FAFSA to determine the distribution of State and institutional student financial aid funds;

(cc) what data are used by States, as of the time of the study, to determine eligibility for State student financial aid, and whether the data are used for merit- or need-based aid;

(dd) whether State data are required by State law, State regulations, or policy directives; and

(ee) the extent to which any State-specific information requirements can be met by completion of a State application linked to the electronic version of the FAFSA; and

(III) information on institutional needs, including the extent to which institutions of higher education are already using supplemental forms to collect additional data from students and their families to determine eligibility for institutional funds; and

(ii) ways to reduce the amount of financial information students and families need to provide to receive a determination of eligibility for student financial aid, taking into account—

(I) the amount of redistribution of Federal grants and subsidized loans under this subchapter caused by such a reduction, and the benefits to be gained by having an application process that will be easier for students and their families;

(II) students and families who do not file income tax returns;

(III) the extent to which the full array of income and asset information collected on the FAFSA, as of the time of the study, plays an important role in the awarding of need-based State financial aid, and whether the State can use an expected family contribution generated by the FAFSA, instead of income and asset information or a calculation with reduced data elements, to support determinations of eligibility for such State aid programs and, if not, what additional information will be needed or what changes to the FAFSA will be required; and

(IV) information on institutional needs, including the extent to which institutions of higher education are already using supplemental forms to collect additional data from students and their families to determine eligibility for institutional funds; and
