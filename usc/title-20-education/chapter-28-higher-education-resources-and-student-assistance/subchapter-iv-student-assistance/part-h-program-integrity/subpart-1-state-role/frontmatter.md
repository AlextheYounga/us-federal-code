Subpart 1 of part H of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, comprising this subpart, was originally added to Pub. L. 89–329, title IV, by Pub. L. 102–325, title IV, §499, July 23, 1992, 106 Stat. 635, and amended by Pub. L. 103–208, Dec. 20, 1993, 107 Stat. 2457. Subpart 1 is shown herein, however, as having been added by Pub. L. 105–244, title IV, §491(2), Oct. 7, 1998, 112 Stat. 1759, without reference to those intervening amendments because of the extensive revision of subpart 1 by Pub. L. 105–244.
