### §2323. Accountability ###

#### (a) Purpose ####

The purpose of this section is to establish and support State and local performance accountability systems, comprised of the activities described in this section, to assess the effectiveness of the State and the eligible recipients of the State in achieving statewide progress in career and technical education, and to optimize the return of investment of Federal funds in career and technical education activities.

#### (b) State performance measures ####

Each eligible agency, with input from eligible recipients, shall establish performance measures for a State that consist of—

(A) the core indicators of performance described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (2);

(B) any additional indicators of performance (if any) identified by the eligible agency under paragraph (2)(C); and

(C) a State adjusted level of performance described in paragraph (3)(A) for each core indicator of performance, and State levels of performance described in paragraph (3)(B) for each additional indicator of performance.

#### (2) Indicators of performance ####

#### (A) Core indicators of performance for career and technical education students at the secondary level ####

Each eligible agency shall identify in the State plan core indicators of performance for career and technical education students at the secondary level that are valid and reliable, and that include, at a minimum, measures of each of the following:
