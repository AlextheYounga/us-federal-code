#### Codification ####

This part was, in the original, designated subtitle A of title II of Pub. L. 105–220 and has been redesignated part A of this subchapter for purposes of codification. This subchapter does not contain a part B, because subtitle B (§251) of title II of Pub. L. 105–220 repealed numerous sections of the Code and has been executed to those sections, see Tables.
