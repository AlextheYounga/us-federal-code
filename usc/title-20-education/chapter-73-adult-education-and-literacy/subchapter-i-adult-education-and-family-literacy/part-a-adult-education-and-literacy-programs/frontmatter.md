#### Codification ####

This part was, in the original, designated subtitle A of title II of Pub. L. 105–220 and was redesignated part A of this subchapter for purposes of codification, prior to repeal of Pub. L. 105–220 by Pub. L. 113–128, title V, §511(a), July 22, 2014, 128 Stat. 1705. This subchapter did not contain a part B, because subtitle B (§251) of title II of Pub. L. 105–220 repealed numerous sections of the Code and was executed to those sections, see Tables.
