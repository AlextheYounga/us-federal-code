Analysis of chapters editorially supplied. Part IV added by Pub. L. 94–131 without adding analysis for chapters 35, 36, and 37.

Pub. L. 96–517 purported to amend the table of chapters of title 35 by adding after the item for chapter 37 the following: "38. Patent Rights in Inventions Made with Federal Assistance". Title 35 did not contain a table of chapters, and section 6(b) of Pub. L. 96–517 and the purported amendment made by it were repealed by Pub. L. 97–256. See chapter 18 (§200 et seq.) of this title.
