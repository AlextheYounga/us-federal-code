**2022**—Pub. L. 117–328, §108(a)(1)–(4), (6)–(8), inserted ", after the meeting of the electors shall have been held," after "When", struck out "and list" after "certificate of vote" and after "send up the certificate", and substituted "in December," for "in December, after the meeting of the electors shall have been held,", "or, if the President of the Senate be absent" for "or, if he be absent", "lodged with such officer" for "lodged with him", "the duty of such chief election officer of the State" for "his duty", and "by the most expeditious method available" for "by registered mail".

Pub. L. 117–328, §108(a)(5), which directed substitution of "chief election officer" for "secretary of State", was executed by making the substitution for "secretary of state" to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

**1984**—Pub. L. 98–497 substituted "Archivist of the United States" for "Administrator of General Services" in section catchline and two places in text.

**1951**—Act Oct. 31, 1951, substituted "Administrator of General Services" for "Secretary of State" in section catchline and two places in text.
