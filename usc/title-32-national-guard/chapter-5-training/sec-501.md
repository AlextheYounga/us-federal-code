|501(a)<br/><br/>501(b)|32:61 (1st 24 words).<br/><br/>32:61 (less 1st 24 words).|June 3, 1916, ch. 134, §91, 39 Stat. 206.|

In subsection (a), the words "that of" are substituted for the words "the system which is or may be prescribed for". The word "Army" is substituted for the words "Regular Army", since the Army is the category for which the discipline and training is prescribed and the Regular Army is a personnel category for which no discipline and training is prescribed. Similarly, the words "Air Force" are used instead of the words "Regular Air Force".
