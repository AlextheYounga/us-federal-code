Section was a composite of provisions in acts May 23, 1908, ch. 192, 35 Stat. 267, and Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 301, 35 Stat. 1051. The provision in act May 23, 1908, ch. 192, which authorized President to reserve and except 12,800 acres for a permanent National Bison Range in Montana, was repealed by Pub. L. 116–260, div. DD, §12(g), Dec. 27, 2020, 134 Stat. 3032. The provision in act Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 301, which directed President to reserve and except a sufficient area to enlarge the Range to not to exceed 20,000 acres, was omitted in view of the probable intent to repeal the entirety of this section by section 12(g) of div. DD of Pub. L. 116—260.
