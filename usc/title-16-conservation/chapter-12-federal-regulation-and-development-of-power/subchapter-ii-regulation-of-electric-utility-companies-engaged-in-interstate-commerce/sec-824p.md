### §824p. Siting of interstate electric transmission facilities ###

#### (a) Designation of national interest electric transmission corridors ####

(1) Not later than 1 year after August 8, 2005, and every 3 years thereafter, the Secretary of Energy (referred to in this section as the "Secretary"), in consultation with affected States and Indian Tribes, shall conduct a study of electric transmission capacity constraints and congestion.

(2) Not less frequently than once every 3 years, the Secretary, after considering alternatives and recommendations from interested parties (including an opportunity for comment from affected States and Indian Tribes), shall issue a report, based on the study under paragraph (1) or other information relating to electric transmission capacity constraints and congestion, which may designate as a national interest electric transmission corridor any geographic area that—

(i) <sup><a href="#824p_1_target" name="824p_1">1</a></sup> is experiencing electric energy transmission capacity constraints or congestion that adversely affects consumers; or

(ii) <sup><a href="#824p_2_target" name="824p_2">2</a></sup> is expected to experience such energy transmission capacity constraints or congestion.

(3) Not less frequently than once every 3 years, the Secretary, in conducting the study under paragraph (1) and issuing the report under paragraph (2), shall consult with any appropriate regional entity referred to in section 824o of this title.

(4) In determining whether to designate a national interest electric transmission corridor under paragraph (2), the Secretary may consider whether—

(A) the economic vitality and development of the corridor, or the end markets served by the corridor, may be constrained by lack of adequate or reasonably priced electricity;

(B)(i) economic growth in the corridor, or the end markets served by the corridor, may be jeopardized by reliance on limited sources of energy; and

(ii) a diversification of supply is warranted;

(C) the energy independence or energy security of the United States would be served by the designation;

(D) the designation would be in the interest of national energy policy;

(E) the designation would enhance national defense and homeland security;

(F) the designation would enhance the ability of facilities that generate or transmit firm or intermittent energy to connect to the electric grid;

(G) the designation—

(i) maximizes existing rights-of-way; and

(ii) avoids and minimizes, to the maximum extent practicable, and offsets to the extent appropriate and practicable, sensitive environmental areas and cultural heritage sites; and

(H) the designation would result in a reduction in the cost to purchase electric energy for consumers.

#### (b) Construction permit ####

Except as provided in subsection (i), the Commission may, after notice and an opportunity for hearing, issue one or more permits for the construction or modification of electric transmission facilities in a national interest electric transmission corridor designated by the Secretary under subsection (a) if the Commission finds that—

(1)(A) a State in which the transmission facilities are to be constructed or modified does not have authority to—

(i) approve the siting of the facilities; or

(ii) consider the interstate benefits or interregional benefits expected to be achieved by the proposed construction or modification of transmission facilities in the State;

(B) the applicant for a permit is a transmitting utility under this chapter but does not qualify to apply for a permit or siting approval for the proposed project in a State because the applicant does not serve end-use customers in the State; or

(C) a State commission or other entity that has authority to approve the siting of the facilities—

(i) has not made a determination on an application seeking approval pursuant to applicable law by the date that is 1 year after the later of—

(I) the date on which the application was filed; and

(II) the date on which the relevant national interest electric transmission corridor was designated by the Secretary under subsection (a);

(ii) has conditioned its approval in such a manner that the proposed construction or modification will not significantly reduce transmission capacity constraints or congestion in interstate commerce or is not economically feasible; or

(iii) has denied an application seeking approval pursuant to applicable law;

(2) the facilities to be authorized by the permit will be used for the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce;

(3) the proposed construction or modification is consistent with the public interest;

(4) the proposed construction or modification will significantly reduce transmission congestion in interstate commerce and protects or benefits consumers;

(5) the proposed construction or modification is consistent with sound national energy policy and will enhance energy independence; and

(6) the proposed modification will maximize, to the extent reasonable and economical, the transmission capabilities of existing towers or structures.

#### (c) Permit applications ####

(1) Permit applications under subsection (b) shall be made in writing to the Commission.

(2) The Commission shall issue rules specifying—

(A) the form of the application;

(B) the information to be contained in the application; and

(C) the manner of service of notice of the permit application on interested persons.

#### (d) Comments ####

In any proceeding before the Commission under subsection (b), the Commission shall afford each State in which a transmission facility covered by the permit is or will be located, each affected Federal agency and Indian tribe, private property owners, and other interested persons, a reasonable opportunity to present their views and recommendations with respect to the need for and impact of a facility covered by the permit.

#### (e) Rights-of-way ####

(1) In the case of a permit under subsection (b) for electric transmission facilities to be located on property other than property owned by the United States or a State, if the permit holder cannot acquire by contract, or is unable to agree with the owner of the property to the compensation to be paid for, the necessary right-of-way to construct or modify, and operate and maintain, the transmission facilities and, in the determination of the Commission, the permit holder has made good faith efforts to engage with landowners and other stakeholders early in the applicable permitting process, the permit holder may acquire the right-of-way by the exercise of the right of eminent domain in the district court of the United States for the district in which the property concerned is located, or in the appropriate court of the State in which the property is located.

(2) Any right-of-way acquired under paragraph (1) shall be used exclusively for the construction or modification of electric transmission facilities within a reasonable period of time after the acquisition.

(3) The practice and procedure in any action or proceeding under this subsection in the district court of the United States shall conform as nearly as practicable to the practice and procedure in a similar action or proceeding in the courts of the State in which the property is located.

(4) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize the use of eminent domain to acquire a right-of-way for any purpose other than the construction, modification, operation, or maintenance of electric transmission facilities and related facilities. The right-of-way cannot be used for any other purpose, and the right-of-way shall terminate upon the termination of the use for which the right-of-way was acquired.

#### (f) Compensation ####

(1) Any right-of-way acquired pursuant to subsection (e) shall be considered a taking of private property for which just compensation is due.

(2) Just compensation shall be an amount equal to the fair market value (including applicable severance damages) of the property taken on the date of the exercise of eminent domain authority.

#### (g) State law ####

Nothing in this section precludes any person from constructing or modifying any transmission facility in accordance with State law.
