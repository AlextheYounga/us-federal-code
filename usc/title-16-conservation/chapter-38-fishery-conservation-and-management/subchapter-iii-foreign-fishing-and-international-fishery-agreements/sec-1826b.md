#### **Editorial Notes** ####

#### Codification ####

Section was enacted as part of the High Seas Driftnet Fisheries Enforcement Act, and not as part of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act which comprises this chapter.

#### Amendments ####

**2015**—Pub. L. 114–81 struck out "or illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing" after "driftnet fishing" and inserted "or effectively addressed the offending activities for which the nation received a negative certification under 1826j(d) or 1826j(c) of this title" before period at end.

**2007**—Pub. L. 109–479 inserted "or illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing" after "driftnet fishing".

[<sup>1</sup> So in original. Probably should be preceded by "section".](#1826b_1)
