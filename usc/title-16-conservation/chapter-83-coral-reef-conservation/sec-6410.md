(7) A description of how the project meets one or more of the criteria under subsection (e)(2).

(8) In the case of a proposal submitted by a coral reef stewardship partnership, a description of how the project aligns with the applicable coral reef action plan in effect under section 6404 of this title.

(9) Any other information the Administrator considers to be necessary for evaluating the eligibility of the project for a grant under this subsection.

#### (e) Project review and approval ####

#### (1) In general ####

The Administrator shall review each coral reef project proposal submitted under this section to determine if the project meets the criteria set forth in subsection (f).

#### (2) Prioritization of conservation projects ####

The Administrator shall prioritize the awarding of funding for projects that meet the criteria for approval described in—

(A) subparagraphs (A) through (G) of subsection (f)(2) that are proposed to be conducted within priority areas identified for coral reef conservation by the Administrator under the National Coral Reef Resilience Strategy; and

(B) subparagraphs (E) through (L) of subsection (f)(2) that are proposed to be conducted within priority areas identified for coral reef restoration by the Administrator under the National Coral Reef Resilience Strategy.

#### (3) Review; approval or disapproval ####

Not later than 180 days after receiving a proposal for a coral reef project under this section, the Administrator shall—

(A) request and consider written comments on the proposal from each Federal agency, State government, covered Native entity, or other government jurisdiction, including the relevant regional fishery management councils established under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), or any National Marine Sanctuary or Marine National Monument, with jurisdiction or management authority over coral reef ecosystems in the area where the project is to be conducted, including the extent to which the project is consistent with locally established priorities, unless such entities were directly involved in the development of the project proposal;

(B) provide for the merit-based peer review of the proposal and require standardized documentation of that peer review;

(C) after considering any written comments and recommendations based on the reviews under subparagraphs (A) and (B), approve or disapprove the proposal; and

(D) provide written notification of that approval or disapproval, with summaries of all written comments, recommendations, and peer reviews, to the entity that submitted the proposal, and each of those States, covered Native entity, and other government jurisdictions that provided comments under subparagraph (A).

#### (f) Criteria for approval ####

The Administrator may not approve a proposal for a coral reef project under this section unless the project—

(1) is consistent with—

(A) the National Coral Reef Resilience Strategy; and

(B) any Federal or non-Federal coral reef action plans in effect under section 6404 of this title covering a coral reef or ecologically significant unit of a coral reef to be affected by the project; and

(2) will enhance the conservation and restoration of coral reefs by—

(A) addressing conflicts arising from the use of environments near coral reefs or from the use of corals, species associated with coral reefs, and coral products, including supporting consensus-driven and community-based planning and management initiatives for the protection of coral reef ecosystems;

(B) improving compliance with laws that prohibit or regulate the taking of coral products or species associated with coral reefs or regulate the use and management of coral reef ecosystems;

(C) designing and implementing networks of real-time water quality monitoring along coral reefs, including data collection related to turbidity, nutrient availability, harmful algal blooms, and plankton assemblages, with an emphasis on coral reefs impacted by agriculture and urban development;

(D) promoting ecologically sound navigation and anchorages, including mooring buoy systems to promote enhanced recreational access, near coral reefs;

(E) furthering the goals and objectives of coral reef action plans in effect under section 6404 of this title;

(F) mapping the location and distribution of coral reefs and potential coral reef habitat;

(G) stimulating innovation to advance the ability of the United States to understand, research, or monitor coral reef ecosystems, or to develop management or adaptation options to conserve and restore coral reef ecosystems;

(H) implementing research to ensure the population viability of coral species in United States waters listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 [16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.] as detailed in the population-based recovery criteria included in species-specific recovery plans established under such Act;

(I) developing and implementing cost-effective methods to restore degraded coral reef ecosystems or to create geographically appropriate coral reef ecosystems in suitable waters, including by improving habitat or promoting success of keystone species, with an emphasis on novel restoration strategies and techniques to advance coral reef recovery and growth near population centers threatened by rising sea levels and storm surge;
