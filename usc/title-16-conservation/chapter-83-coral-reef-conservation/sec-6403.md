#### **Editorial Notes** ####

#### References in Text ####

Section 6412 of this title, referred to in subsecs. (b)(2)(C) and (c)(3), probably should be a reference to section 6411 of this title which relates to reef research coordination institutes and coral reef research centers. Subsec. (b)(1)(B) of section 6412 of this title probably should be a reference to section 6411(a)(1) of this title which requires the designation of reef research coordination institutes. Section 6412(b) does not contain a par. (1)(B).

#### Prior Provisions ####

A prior section 6403, Pub. L. 106–562, title II, §204, Dec. 23, 2000, 114 Stat. 2801, related to coral reef conservation program, prior to repeal by Pub. L. 117–263, div. J, title C, §10001(a), Dec. 23, 2022, 136 Stat. 3931.
