### §8101. Findings and purposes ###

#### (a) Findings ####

The Congress finds the following:

(1) Wetlands, tidal marshes, and agricultural lands provide significant cultural, economic, and ecological benefits to the Nation.

(2) The South American nutria (Myocastor coypus) is directly contributing to substantial marsh loss on Federal, State, and private land.

(3) Traditional harvest methods to control or eradicate nutria have failed. Consequently, marsh loss, loss of public and private wetlands, and loss of agricultural lands are accelerating.

(4) The nutria eradication and control pilot program authorized by Public Law 105–322 is to develop new and effective methods for eradication of nutria.

#### (b) Purpose ####

The purpose of this chapter is to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to provide financial assistance to any State that has demonstrated the need for a program to implement measures to eradicate or control nutria and restore marshland damaged by nutria.
