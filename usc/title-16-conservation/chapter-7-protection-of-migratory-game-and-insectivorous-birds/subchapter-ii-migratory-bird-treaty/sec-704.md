(1) take any migratory game bird by the aid of baiting, or on or over any baited area, if the person knows or reasonably should know that the area is a baited area; or

(2) place or direct the placement of bait on or adjacent to an area for the purpose of causing, inducing, or allowing any person to take or attempt to take any migratory game bird by the aid of baiting on or over the baited area.

(c) Federal Framework Closing Date for Hunting of Ducks, Mergansers, and Coots.—

(1) Regulations relating to framework closing date.—

(A) In general.—In promulgating regulations under subsection (a) relating to the Federal framework for the closing date up to which the States may select seasons for migratory bird hunting, except as provided in paragraph (2), the Secretary shall, with respect to the hunting season for ducks, mergansers, and coots—

(i) subject to subparagraph (B), adopt the recommendation of each respective flyway council (as defined in section 20.152 of title 50, Code of Federal Regulations) for the Federal framework if the Secretary determines that the recommendation is consistent with science-based and sustainable harvest management; and

(ii) allow the States to establish the closing date for the hunting season in accordance with the Federal framework.

(B) Requirement.—The framework closing date promulgated by the Secretary under subparagraph (A) shall not be later than January 31 of each year.

(2) Special hunting days for youths, veterans, and active military personnel.—

Such days shall be treated as separate from, and in addition to, the annual Federal framework hunting season lengths.

(B) Requirements.—In selecting days under subparagraph (A), a State shall ensure that—

(i) the days selected—

(I) may only include the hunting of duck, geese, swan, merganser, coot, moorhen, and gallinule species that are eligible for hunting under the applicable annual Federal framework;

(II) are not more than 14 days before or after the Federal framework hunting season for ducks, mergansers, and coots; and

(ii) the total number of days in a hunting season for any migratory bird species, including any days selected under subparagraph (A), is not more than 107 days.

(C) Limitation.—A State may combine the 2 days allowed for youths with the 2 days allowed for veterans and members of the Armed Forces on active duty under subparagraph (A), but in no circumstance may a State have more than a total of 4 additional days added to its regular hunting season for any purpose.

(3) Regulations.—The Secretary shall promulgate regulations in accordance with this subsection for the Federal framework for migratory bird hunting for the 2019–2020 hunting season and each hunting season thereafter.
