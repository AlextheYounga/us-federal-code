### §4310. Establishment of Cave Research Program ###

#### (a) Establishment ####

In order to provide for needed research relating to cave resources on certain lands in the United States, the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the National Park Service shall establish and administer a Cave Research Program (hereinafter in this section referred to as the "Program"). The Program shall include the orderly and scholarly collection, analysis, and dissemination of research material related to caves in lands managed by the National Park Service including, but not limited to, Carlsbad Caverns National Park and the Capitan Reef area.

#### (b) Functions ####

The Program shall produce educational and interpretive information and materials vital to public understanding of cave geology, assist students and researchers, and provide for a comprehensive evaluation of cave resources and measures needed for their protection.

#### (c) Emphasis ####

The program <sup><a href="#4310_1_target" name="4310_1">1</a></sup> shall be directed primarily toward lands managed by the National Park Service, but the Secretary of the Interior may enter into cooperative agreements with other agencies or entities as may be appropriate to carry out the purposes of this section.

"(1) The World's most exposed fossil reef, Capitan Reef, in southern New Mexico that includes Carlsbad Caverns, contains over 300 caves, including 75 identified caves in Carlsbad Caverns National Park and 22 caves in Guadalupe Mountains National Park.

"(2) Recent explorations of Lechuguilla Cave at Carlsbad Caverns National Park have provided much new information about the wonders of this cave including the fact that it is the second deepest cave in the United States and contains outstanding world-class cave features such as gypsum crystal chandeliers and gypsum flowers.

"(3) The Lechuguilla Cave has been described by cave researchers as possibly the finest cave in America.

"(4) The interest and excitement of cave researchers throughout the world have been focused on Carlsbad Caverns National Park.

"(5) Cave researchers could use this research institute as an operational base for study of caves in other regions and as a focal point for storage of data on cave geology and speleology.

"(6) The Congress, with the passage of Public Law 100–691, the Federal Cave Resources Protection Act of 1988 [16 U.S.C. 4301 et seq.], recognized the significance of cave resources on Federal lands and established the policy that Federal lands be managed in a manner which protects and maintains, to the extent practicable, significant cave resources."
