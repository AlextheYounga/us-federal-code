### §4301. Findings, purposes, and policy ###

#### (a) Findings ####

The Congress finds and declares that—

(1) significant caves on Federal lands are an invaluable and irreplaceable part of the Nation's natural heritage; and

(2) in some instances, these significant caves are threatened due to improper use, increased recreational demand, urban spread, and a lack of specific statutory protection.

#### (b) Purposes ####

The purposes of this chapter are—

(1) to secure, protect, and preserve significant caves on Federal lands for the perpetual use, enjoyment, and benefit of all people; and

(2) to foster increased cooperation and exchange of information between governmental authorities and those who utilize caves located on Federal lands for scientific, education, or recreational purposes.

#### (c) Policy ####

It is the policy of the United States that Federal lands be managed in a manner which protects and maintains, to the extent practical, significant caves.
