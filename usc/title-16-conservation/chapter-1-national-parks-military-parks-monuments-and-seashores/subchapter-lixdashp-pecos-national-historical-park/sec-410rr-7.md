Pub. L. 101–536, §2, Nov. 8, 1990, 104 Stat. 2368, provided that:

"(a) Findings.—The Congress makes the following findings:

"(1) the Civil War battle of Glorieta Pass, New Mexico, fought on March 26–28, 1862, was a decisive battle of the Civil War in the Far West;

"(3) the campsite and headquarters of the Union forces during the Battle of Glorieta are currently within the boundary of Pecos National Historical Park.

"(b) Purpose.—The purpose of this Act [enacting this section and provisions set out as a note under section 410rr of this title] is to preserve and interpret the Battle of Glorieta and to enhance visitor understanding of the Civil War and the Far West by establishing a new unit of Pecos National Historical Park."
