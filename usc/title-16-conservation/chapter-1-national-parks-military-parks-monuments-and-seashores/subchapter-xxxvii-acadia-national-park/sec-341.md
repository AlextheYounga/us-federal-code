#### "SEC. 102. LANDS WITHIN BOUNDARIES. ####

"(a) The Secretary is authorized to acquire lands and interests therein within the boundaries of the Park by donation, exchange (in accordance with this section), or purchase with donated or appropriated funds, except that—

"(1) any lands or interests therein owned by the State of Maine or any political subdivision thereof may be acquired only by donation or exchange; and

"(2) privately owned lands or interests therein may be acquired only with the consent of the owner thereof unless the Secretary determines that the property is being developed or proposed to be developed in a manner which is detrimental to the scenic, historical, cultural, and other values for which the Park was established.

"(b)(1) Not later than 6 months after the enactment of this Act [Sept. 25, 1986], the Secretary shall publish specific guidelines under which determinations shall be made under subsection (a)(2). The Secretary shall provide adequate opportunity for public comment on such guidelines. The guidelines shall provide for notice to the Secretary prior to commencement of any proposed development within the boundaries of the Park. The Secretary shall provide written notice to the owner of the property of any determination proposed to be made under subsection (a)(2) and shall provide the owner a reasonable opportunity to comment on such proposal.

"(2) For purposes of this section, except as provided in paragraph (3), development or proposed development of private property within the boundaries of the Park that is significantly different from, or a significant expansion of, development existing as of November 1, 1985, shall be considered by the Secretary as detrimental to the values for which the Park was established.

"(c)(1) The owners of any private property within the Park may, on the date of its acquisition by the Secretary and as a condition of such acquisition, retain for himself and his successors or assigns a right to use and occupancy for a definite term of not more than 25 years, or ending at the death of the owner, or his spouse, whichever is later. The owners shall elect the term to be reserved. The Secretary shall pay to the owner the fair market value of the property on the date of such acquisition, less the fair market value, of the right retained by the owner.

"(2) Any such right retained pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe and may be terminated by the Secretary upon his determination and after reasonable notice to the owner thereof that such property is being used for any purpose which is incompatible with the administration of the Park or with the preservation of the resources therein. Such right shall terminate by operation of law upon notification to the owner by the Secretary and tendering to the owner the amount equal to the fair market value of that portion which remains unexpired.

"(d)(1) In exercising his authority to acquire lands by exchange pursuant to this title, the Secretary may accept title to non-Federal property located within the boundary of the Park and may convey to the grantor of such property any federally owned property under the jurisdiction of the Secretary which lies outside said boundary and depicted on the map.

"(5) No easement may be acquired by the Secretary under this subsection without first consulting with, and providing written notification to, the town in which the land is located and the Acadia National Park Advisory Commission established by section 103 of this title. In providing such notification, the Secretary shall indicate the manner and degree to which the easement meets the criteria provided in this subsection.
