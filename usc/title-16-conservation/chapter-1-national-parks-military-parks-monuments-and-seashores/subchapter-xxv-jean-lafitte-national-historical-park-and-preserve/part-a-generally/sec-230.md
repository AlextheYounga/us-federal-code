#### **Editorial Notes** ####

#### Amendments ####

**2009**—Pub. L. 111–11, §7105(f)(2)(B), which directed amendment of title IX of Pub. L. 95–625 by substituting "Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve" for "Jean Lafitte National Historical Park" each place it appears, was not executed to first sentence or cl. (1) of second sentence of this section, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because "Jean Lafitte National Historical Park" already appeared in those places preceding "and Preserve".

Pub. L. 111–11, §7105(a), in second sentence, substituted "generally depicted on the map entitled 'Boundary Map, Barataria Preserve Unit, Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve', numbered 467/80100A, and dated December 2007," for "of approximately twenty thousand acres generally depicted on the map entitled 'Barataria Marsh Unit-Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve' numbered 90,000B and dated April 1978,".

**1988**—Pub. L. 100–250 added cl. (4) and redesignated former cls. (4) and (5) as (5) and (6), respectively.
