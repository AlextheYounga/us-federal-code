Subject to the provisions of section 410ff of this title, the Secretary shall administer the park in accordance with the provisions of the Act of August 25, 1916 (39 Stat. 535), as amended and supplemented (16 U.S.C. 1 et seq.).<sup><a href="#410ff-3_1_target" name="410ff-3_1">1</a></sup> In the administration of the park, the Secretary may utilize such statutory authority available for the conservation and management of wildlife and natural and cultural resources as he deems appropriate to carry out the purposes of this subchapter. The park shall be administered on a low-intensity, limited-entry basis.

#### (b) Limited visitor use; establishment of appropriate visitor carrying capacities ####

In recognition of the special fragility and sensitivity of the park's resources, it is the intent of Congress that the visitor use within the park be limited to assure negligible adverse impact on the park resources. The Secretary shall establish appropriate visitor carrying capacities for the park.

(1) Within three complete fiscal years from March 5, 1980, the Secretary, in consultation with The Nature Conservancy and the State of California, shall submit to the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs of the United States House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate, a comprehensive general management plan for the park, pursuant to criteria stated in the provisions of section 100502 of title 54.
