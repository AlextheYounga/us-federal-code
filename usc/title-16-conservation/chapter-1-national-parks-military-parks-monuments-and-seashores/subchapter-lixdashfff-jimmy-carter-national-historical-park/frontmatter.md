### SUBCHAPTER LIX–FFF—JIMMY CARTER NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK ###

#### **Editorial Notes** ####

#### Codification ####

Pub. L. 100–206, which enacted this subchapter, originally established the Jimmy Carter National Historic Site, which is listed in a table of National Historic Sites under section 320101 of Title 54, National Park Service and Related Programs. The amendments made by Pub. L. 116–341 effectively redesignated the site as the Jimmy Carter National Historical Park, after which the text of Pub. L. 100–206 was set out as this subchapter.
