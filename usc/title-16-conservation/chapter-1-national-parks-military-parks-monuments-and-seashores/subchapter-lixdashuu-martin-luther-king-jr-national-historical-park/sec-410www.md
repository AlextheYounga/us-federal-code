#### Findings and Purpose ####

Pub. L. 108–314, §2, Oct. 5, 2004, 118 Stat. 1198, provided that:

"(a) Findings.—Congress finds the following:

"(1) Public Law 96–438 [probably means 96–428, enacting this subchapter] established the Martin Luther King, Junior, National Historic Site [now Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historical Park], and allows acquisition, by donation only, of lands owned by the State.

"(2) The National Park Service owns a vacant lot that has no historic significance. The City of Atlanta has expressed interest in acquiring this property to encourage commercial development along Edgewood Avenue.

"(3) The National Historic Site Visitor Center and Museum is land-locked and has no emergency ingress or egress, making it virtually impossible for firefighting equipment to reach.

"(4) The acquisition of city-owned property would enable the National Park Service to establish easy street access to the National Historic Site Visitor Center and Museum, and would benefit the City by exchanging a piece of property that the City could develop.

"(b) Purpose.—The purpose of this Act [see Short Title of 2004 Amendment note above] is to authorize the exchange of certain lands within the Martin Luther King, Junior, National Historic Site for lands owned by the City of Atlanta, Georgia."
