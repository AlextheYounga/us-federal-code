### SUBCHAPTER LIX–GGG—BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK ###

#### **Editorial Notes** ####

#### Codification ####

Pub. L. 102–525, title I, which enacted this subchapter, originally established the Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site, which is listed in a table of National Historic Sites under section 320101 of Title 54, National Park Service and Related Programs. The amendments made by Pub. L. 117–123 effectively redesignated the site as the Brown v. Board of Education National Historical Park, after which the text of Pub. L. 102–525, title I, was set out as this subchapter.

Pub. L. 117–123, §2(c)(1), May 12, 2022, 136 Stat. 1196, substituted "HISTORICAL PARK" for "HISTORIC SITE" in heading.
