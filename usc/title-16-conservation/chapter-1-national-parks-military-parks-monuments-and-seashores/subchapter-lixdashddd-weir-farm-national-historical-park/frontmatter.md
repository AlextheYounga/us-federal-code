### SUBCHAPTER LIX–DDD—WEIR FARM NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK ###

#### Codification ####

Pub. L. 101–485, which enacted this subchapter, originally established the Weir Farm National Historic Site, which is listed in a table of National Historic Sites under section 320101 of Title 54, National Park Service and Related Programs. The amendments made by Pub. L. 116–305 effectively redesignated the site as the Weir Farm National Historical Park, after which the text of Pub. L. 101–485 was set out as this subchapter.
