#### Codification ####

Pub. L. 96–428, which enacted this subchapter, originally established the Martin Luther King, Junior, National Historic Site, which is listed in a table of National Historic Sites under section 320101 of Title 54, National Park Service and Related Programs. The amendments made by Pub. L. 115–108 effectively redesignated the site as the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historical Park, after which the text of Pub. L. 96–428 was set out as this subchapter.
