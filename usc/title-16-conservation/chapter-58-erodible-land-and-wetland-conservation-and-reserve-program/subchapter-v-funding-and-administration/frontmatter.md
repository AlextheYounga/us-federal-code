### SUBCHAPTER V—FUNDING AND ADMINISTRATION ###

#### Codification ####

Subtitle E of title XII of the Food Security Act, comprising this subchapter, was originally enacted by Pub. L. 99–198, title XII, Dec. 23, 1985, 99 Stat. 1514, and amended by Pub. L. 101–624, Nov. 28, 1990, 104 Stat. 3359; Pub. L. 102–237, Dec. 13, 1991, 105 Stat. 1818; Pub. L. 102–552, Oct. 28, 1992, 106 Stat. 4102; and Pub. L. 104–66, Dec. 21, 1995, 109 Stat. 707. Subtitle E was shown herein, however, as having been added by Pub. L. 104–127, title III, §341, Apr. 4, 1996, 110 Stat. 1007, without reference to the intervening amendments because of the extensive revision of the subtitle's provisions by Pub. L. 104–127. Subsequently, subtitle E was amended by Pub. L. 107–171 to add new sections 3841, 3842, and 3844 and to repeal former sections 3841 and 3842.
