### Part IV—Environmental Quality Incentives Program and Conservation Stewardship Program ###

#### Codification ####

Pub. L. 115–334, title II, §2301(a)(1), Dec. 20, 2018, 132 Stat. 4551, substituted "Environmental Quality Incentives Program and Conservation Stewardship Program" for "Environmental Quality Incentives Program" in part heading.

Chapter 4 of subtitle D of title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985, comprising this part, was originally added to Pub. L. 99–198 by Pub. L. 104–127, title III, §334, Apr. 4, 1996, 110 Stat. 996. Chapter 4 is shown herein, however, as having been added by Pub. L. 107–171, title II, §2301, May 13, 2002, 116 Stat. 253, because of the extensive revision of the chapter's provisions by Pub. L. 107–171. Such revision did not contain a chapter heading, which was subsequently added by Pub. L. 110–234, title II, §2501(b), May 22, 2008, 122 Stat. 1058, and Pub. L. 110–246, §4(a), title II, §2501(b), June 18, 2008, 122 Stat. 1664, 1786. Pub. L. 110–234 was repealed by section 4(a) of Pub. L. 110–246 effective May 22, 2008, the date of enactment of Pub. L. 110–234.
