#### (c) Ranking of offers ####

#### (1) Conservation benefits and funding considerations ####

When evaluating offers from landowners, the Secretary may consider—

(A) the conservation benefits of obtaining an easement or other interest in the land;

(B) the cost-effectiveness of each easement or other interest in eligible land, so as to maximize the environmental benefits per dollar expended; and

(C) whether the landowner or another person is offering to contribute financially to the cost of the easement or other interest in the land to leverage Federal funds.

#### (2) Additional considerations ####

In determining the acceptability of easement offers, the Secretary may take into consideration—

(B) the productivity of the land; and

(C) the on-farm and off-farm environmental threats if the land is used for the production of agricultural commodities.

#### (d) Easement priority ####

In carrying out this subpart, to the extent practicable, taking into consideration costs and future agricultural and food needs, the Secretary shall give priority to obtaining permanent conservation easements before shorter term conservation easements and, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, shall place priority on acquiring easements based on the value of the easement for protecting and enhancing habitat for migratory birds and other wildlife.
