Section 669c(d) of this title, referred to in par. (9), was in the original "section 304(d)", and was translated as reading "section 4(d)", meaning section 4(d) of Act Sept. 2, 1937, ch. 899, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because Act Sept. 2, 1937, ch. 899, does not contain a section 304(d), and section 4(d) relates to wildlife conservation and restoration programs. Section 669c(d) of this title was redesignated section 669c(e) of this title by Pub. L. 116–94, div. P, title V, §501(d)(2)(A), Dec. 20, 2019, 133 Stat. 3192.
