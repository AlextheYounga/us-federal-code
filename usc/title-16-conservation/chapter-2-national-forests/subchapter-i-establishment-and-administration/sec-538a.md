(B) to respond to changing resource conditions and public input;

(6) convert National Forest System roads to National Forest System trails, while allowing for continued use for motorized and nonmotorized recreation, to the extent the use is compatible with the management status of the road or trail;

(7) decommission temporary roads—

(A) that were constructed before November 15, 2021—

(i) for emergency operations; or

(ii) to facilitate a resource extraction project;

(B) that were designated as a temporary road by the Secretary; and

(C)(i) in violation of section 1608(b) of this title, on which vegetation cover has not been reestablished; or

(ii) that have not been fully decommissioned; and

#### (c) Project selection ####

#### (1) Project eligibility ####

(A) is adequate to meet any increasing demands for timber, recreation, and other uses;

(B) provides for intensive use, protection, development, and management of the land under principles of multiple use and sustained yield of products and services;

(C) does not damage, degrade, or impair adjacent resources, including aquatic and wildlife resources, to the extent practicable;

(D) reflects long-term funding expectations; and

(E) is adequate for supporting emergency operations, such as evacuation routes during wildfires, floods, and other natural disasters; and

(2) all projects funded under the Program are consistent with any applicable forest plan or travel management plan.
