(B) to facilitate data and information access across scientific disciplines, scientists, and managers;

(C) to facilitate public access to national and regional marine mammal health, stranding, entanglement, and mortality data, including visualizations and metadata, through the national and regional data portals of the Observation System; and

(D) in collaboration with, and with input from, States and stranding network participants.

#### (d) Procedures and guidelines ####

The Secretary shall establish and implement policies, protocols, and standards for—

(1) reporting marine mammal health data collected by stranding networks consistent with subsections (c) and (d) of section 1421a of this title;

(2) promptly transmitting health data from the stranding networks and other appropriate data providers to the Health MAP;

(3) disseminating and making publicly available data on marine mammal health, stranding, entanglement, and mortality data in a timely and sustained manner; and

(4) integrating additional marine mammal health, stranding, or other relevant data as the Secretary determines appropriate.

#### (e) Consultation ####

The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shall maintain and update the Health MAP in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior and the Marine Mammal Commission.
