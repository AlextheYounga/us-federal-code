Subtitle H of title XV of the Agriculture and Food Act of 1981, comprising this subchapter, was originally enacted by Pub. L. 97–98, title XV, Dec. 22, 1981, 95 Stat. 1337, and amended by Pub. L. 101–624, Nov. 28, 1990, 104 Stat. 3359; Pub. L. 104–127, Apr. 4, 1996, 110 Stat. 888. Subtitle H is shown herein, however, as having been added by Pub. L. 107–171, title II, §2504, May 13, 2002, 116 Stat. 269, without reference to the intervening amendments because of the extensive revision of the subtitle's provisions by Pub. L. 107–171.
