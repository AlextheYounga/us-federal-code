#### **Statutory Notes and Related Subsidiaries** ####

#### Congressional Findings—National Whale Conservation ####

Pub. L. 105–277, div. A, §101(b) [title IX, §902], Oct. 21, 1998, 112 Stat. 2681–50, 2681–119, provided that: "Congress finds that—

"(1) the populations of whales that occur in waters of the United States are resources of substantial ecological, scientific, socioeconomic, and esthetic value;

"(2) whale populations—

"(A) form a significant component of marine ecosystems;

"(B) are the subject of intense research;

"(C) provide for a multimillion dollar whale watching tourist industry that provides the public an opportunity to enjoy and learn about great whales and the ecosystems of which the whales are a part; and

"(D) are of importance to Native Americans for cultural and subsistence purposes;

"(3) whale populations are in various stages of recovery, and some whale populations, such as the northern right whale (Eubaleana glacialis) remain perilously close to extinction;

"(4) the interactions that occur between ship traffic, commercial fishing, whale watching vessels, and other recreational vessels and whale populations may affect whale populations adversely;

"(5) the exploration and development of oil, gas, and hard mineral resources, marine debris, chemical pollutants, noise, and other anthropogenic sources of change in the habitat of whales may affect whale populations adversely;

"(6) the conservation of whale populations is subject to difficult challenges related to—

"(A) the migration of whale populations across international boundaries;

"(B) the size of individual whales, as that size precludes certain conservation research procedures that may be used for other animal species, such as captive research and breeding;

"(C) the low reproductive rates of whales that require long-term conservation programs to ensure recovery of whale populations; and

"(D) the occurrence of whale populations in offshore waters where undertaking research, monitoring, and conservation measures is difficult and costly;

"(7)(A) the Secretary of Commerce, through the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, has research and regulatory responsibility for the conservation of whales under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.); and

"(B) the heads of other Federal agencies and the Marine Mammal Commission established under section 201 of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1401) have related research and management activities under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 or the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.);

"(8) the funding available for the activities described in paragraph (8) [(7)] is insufficient to support all necessary whale conservation and recovery activities; and

"(9) there is a need to facilitate the use of funds from non-Federal sources to carry out the conservation of whales."
