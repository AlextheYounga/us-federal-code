#### (c) Adjustments ####

#### (1) Inflation adjustment ####

For fiscal year 2019 and subsequent fiscal years, the revenues established in subsection (b) shall be adjusted by the Secretary by notice, published in the Federal Register, for a fiscal year, to equal the product of the total revenues established in such notice for the prior fiscal year multiplied by an amount equal to the sum of—

(A) one;

(B) the average annual percent change in the cost, per full-time equivalent position of the Food and Drug Administration, of all personnel compensation and benefits paid with respect to such positions for the first 3 years of the preceding 4 fiscal years multiplied by the proportion of personnel compensation and benefits costs to total costs of human generic drug activities for the first 3 years of the preceding 4 fiscal years; and

(C) the average annual percent change that occurred in the Consumer Price Index for urban consumers (Washington-Baltimore, DC–MD–VA–WV; Not Seasonally Adjusted; All items; Annual Index) for the first 3 years of the preceding 4 years of available data multiplied by the proportion of all costs other than personnel compensation and benefits costs to total costs of human generic drug activities for the first 3 years of the preceding 4 fiscal years.

#### (2) Final year adjustment ####

For fiscal year 2022, the Secretary may, in addition to adjustments under paragraph (1), further increase the fee revenues and fees established in subsection (b) if such an adjustment is necessary to provide for not more than 3 months of operating reserves of carryover user fees for human generic drug activities for the first 3 months of fiscal year 2023. If such an adjustment is necessary, the rationale for the amount of the increase shall be contained in the annual notice establishing fee revenues and fees for fiscal year 2022. If the Secretary has carryover balances for such activities in excess of 3 months of such operating reserves, the adjustment under this subparagraph shall not be made.

#### (d) Annual fee setting ####

#### (1) Fiscal years 2018 through 2022 ####

#### (2) Fee for active pharmaceutical ingredient information not included by reference to Type II active pharmaceutical ingredient drug master file ####

In establishing the fee under paragraph (1), the amount of the fee under subsection (a)(3)(F) shall be determined by multiplying—

(A) the sum of—

(i) the total number of such active pharmaceutical ingredients in such submission; and

(ii) for each such ingredient that is manufactured at more than one such facility, the total number of such additional facilities; and

(B) the amount equal to the drug master file fee established in subsection (a)(2) for such submission.
