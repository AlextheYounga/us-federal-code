Reg. 47220). The workload categories used in applying such methodology in forecasting shall include only the activities described in that notice and, as feasible, additional activities that are directly related to the direct review of biosimilar biological product applications and supplements, including additional formal meeting types, the direct review of postmarketing commitments and requirements, the direct review of risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, and the direct review of annual reports for approved biosimilar biological products. Subject to the exceptions in the preceding sentence, the Secretary shall not include as workload categories in applying such methodology in forecasting any non-core review activities, including those activities that the Secretary referenced for potential future use in such notice but did not utilize in setting fees for fiscal year 2021.

#### (C) Limitations ####

#### (D) Publication in Federal Register ####

The Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register notice under paragraph (5) the fee revenue and fees resulting from the adjustment and the methodologies under this paragraph.

#### (4) Operating reserve adjustment ####

#### (A) Increase ####

For fiscal year 2023 and subsequent fiscal years, the Secretary shall, in addition to adjustments under paragraphs (1), (2), and (3), further increase the fee revenue and fees if such an adjustment is necessary to provide for at least 10 weeks of operating reserves of carryover user fees for the process for the review of biosimilar biological product applications.

#### (B) Decrease ####

#### (i) Fiscal year 2023 ####

For fiscal year 2023, if the Secretary has carryover balances for such process in excess of 33 weeks of such operating reserves, the Secretary shall decrease such fee revenue and fees to provide for not more than 33 weeks of such operating reserves.

#### (ii) Fiscal year 2024 ####

For fiscal year 2024, if the Secretary has carryover balances for such process in excess of 27 weeks of such operating reserves, the Secretary shall decrease such fee revenue and fees to provide for not more than 27 weeks of such operating reserves.

#### (iii) Fiscal year 2025 and subsequent fiscal years ####

For fiscal year 2025 and subsequent fiscal years, if the Secretary has carryover balances for such process in excess of 21 weeks of such operating reserves, the Secretary shall decrease such fee revenue and fees to provide for not more than 21 weeks of such operating reserves.

#### (C) Federal Register notice ####

#### (1) Waiver of application fee ####

The Secretary shall grant to a person who is named in a biosimilar biological product application a waiver from the application fee assessed to that person under subsection (a)(2)(A) for the first biosimilar biological product application that a small business or its affiliate submits to the Secretary for review. After a small business or its affiliate is granted such a waiver, the small business or its affiliate shall pay application fees for all subsequent biosimilar biological product applications submitted to the Secretary for review in the same manner as an entity that is not a small business.

#### (2) Considerations ####

In determining whether to grant a waiver of a fee under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consider only the circumstances and assets of the applicant involved and any affiliate of the applicant.

#### (1) In general ####

Subject to paragraph (2), fees authorized under subsection (a) shall be collected and available for obligation only to the extent and in the amount provided in advance in appropriations Acts. Such fees are authorized to remain available until expended. Such sums as may be necessary may be transferred from the Food and Drug Administration salaries and expenses appropriation account without fiscal year limitation to such appropriation account for salaries and expenses with such fiscal year limitation. The sums transferred shall be available solely for the process for the review of biosimilar biological product applications.

#### (2) Collections and appropriation Acts ####

Subject to subparagraphs (C) and (D), the fees authorized by this section shall be collected and available in each fiscal year in an amount not to exceed the amount specified in appropriation Acts, or otherwise made available for obligation for such fiscal year.

#### (B) Use of fees and limitations ####

#### (i) In general ####

The fees authorized by this section shall be available—

(I) for fiscal year 2023, to defray the costs of the process for the review of biosimilar biological product applications (including such costs for an additional number of full-time equivalent positions in the Department of Health and Human Services to be engaged in such process), only if the Secretary allocates for such purpose an amount for such fiscal year (excluding amounts from fees collected under this section) no less than $20,000,000, multiplied by the adjustment factor applicable to such fiscal year; and

(II) for fiscal year 2024 and each subsequent fiscal year, to defray the costs of the process for the review of biosimilar biological product applications (including such costs for an additional number of full-time equivalent positions in the Department of Health and Human Services to be engaged in such process), only if the sum of the amounts allocated by the Secretary for such costs, excluding costs paid from fees collected under this section, plus other costs for the maintenance, renovation, and repair of facilities and acquisition, maintenance, and repair of fixtures, furniture, and other necessary materials and supplies in connection with the process for the review of biosimilar biological product applications, is no less than $20,000,000, multiplied by the adjustment factor applicable to the fiscal year involved.

A request submitted under this paragraph shall include any legal authorities under which the request is made.

#### (i) Construction ####

This section may not be construed to require that the number of full-time equivalent positions in the Department of Health and Human Services, for officers, employers, and advisory committees not engaged in the process of the review of biosimilar biological product applications, be reduced to offset the number of officers, employees, and advisory committees so engaged.
