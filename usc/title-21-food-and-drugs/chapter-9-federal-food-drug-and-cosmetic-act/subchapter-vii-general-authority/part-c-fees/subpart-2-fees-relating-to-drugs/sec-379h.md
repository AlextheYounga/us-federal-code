#### (E) Publication in Federal Register ####

The Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register notice under paragraph (5) of the fee revenue and fees resulting from the adjustment and the methodologies under this paragraph.

#### (3) Operating reserve adjustment ####

#### (A) Increase ####

For fiscal year 2018 and subsequent fiscal years, the Secretary may, in addition to adjustments under paragraphs (1) and (2), further increase the fee revenue and fees if such an adjustment is necessary to provide for not more than 14 weeks of operating reserves of carryover user fees for the process for the review of human drug applications.

#### (B) Decrease ####

#### (C) Notice of rationale ####

If an adjustment under subparagraph (A) or (B) is made, the rationale for the amount of the increase or decrease (as applicable) in fee revenue and fees shall be contained in the annual Federal Register notice under paragraph (5) establishing fee revenue and fees for the fiscal year involved.

#### (5) Annual fee setting ####

The Secretary shall, not later than 60 days before the start of each fiscal year that begins after September 30, 2017—

#### (d) Fee waiver or reduction ####

#### (1) In general ####

The Secretary shall grant to a person who is named as the applicant in a human drug application a waiver from or a reduction of one or more fees assessed to that person under subsection (a) where the Secretary finds that—

(A) such waiver or reduction is necessary to protect the public health,

(B) the assessment of the fee would present a significant barrier to innovation because of limited resources available to such person or other circumstances, or

(C) the applicant involved is a small business submitting its first human drug application to the Secretary for review.

#### (2) Considerations ####

In determining whether to grant a waiver or reduction of a fee under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consider only the circumstances and assets of the applicant involved and any affiliate of the applicant.

#### (3) Rules relating to small businesses ####

#### (A) "Small business" defined ####

In paragraph (1)(C), the term "small business" means an entity that has fewer than 500 employees, including employees of affiliates, and that does not have a drug product that has been approved under a human drug application and introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce.

#### (B) Waiver of application fee ####

The Secretary shall waive under paragraph (1)(C) the application fee for the first human drug application that a small business or its affiliate submits to the Secretary for review.

#### (e) Effect of failure to pay fees ####

A human drug application or supplement submitted by a person subject to fees under subsection (a) shall be considered incomplete and shall not be accepted for filing by the Secretary until all such fees owed by such person have been paid.

#### (f) Limitations ####

#### (1) In general ####

Fees under subsection (a) shall be refunded for a fiscal year beginning after fiscal year 1997 unless appropriations for salaries and expenses of the Food and Drug Administration for such fiscal year (excluding the amount of fees appropriated for such fiscal year) are equal to or greater than the amount of appropriations for the salaries and expenses of the Food and Drug Administration for the fiscal year 1997 (excluding the amount of fees appropriated for such fiscal year) multiplied by the adjustment factor applicable to the fiscal year involved.

#### (2) Authority ####

If the Secretary does not assess fees under subsection (a) during any portion of a fiscal year because of paragraph (1) and if at a later date in such fiscal year the Secretary may assess such fees, the Secretary may assess and collect such fees, without any modification in the rate, for human drug applications and prescription drug program fees at any time in such fiscal year notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) relating to the date fees are to be paid.

#### (3) Limitation ####

Beginning on October 1, 2023, the authorities under section 379g(7)(C) of this title shall include only expenditures for leasing and necessary scientific equipment.

#### (g) Crediting and availability of fees ####

#### (1) In general ####

Subject to paragraph (2)(C), fees authorized under subsection (a) shall be collected and available for obligation only to the extent and in the amount provided in advance in appropriations Acts. Such fees are authorized to remain available until expended. Such sums as may be necessary may be transferred from the Food and Drug Administration salaries and expenses appropriation account without fiscal year limitation to such appropriation account for salaries and expenses with such fiscal year limitation. The sums transferred shall be available solely for the process for the review of human drug applications.

#### (2) Collections and appropriation acts ####

#### (A) In general ####

The fees authorized by this section—

(i) subject to subparagraph (C), shall be collected and available in each fiscal year in an amount not to exceed the amount specified in appropriation Acts, or otherwise made available for obligation, for such fiscal year, and

(ii) shall be available to defray increases in the costs of the resources allocated for the process for the review of human drug applications (including increases in such costs for an additional number of full-time equivalent positions in the Department of Health and Human Services to be engaged in such process) over such costs, excluding costs paid from fees collected under this section, for fiscal year 1997 multiplied by the adjustment factor.

#### (B) Compliance ####

The Secretary shall be considered to have met the requirements of subparagraph (A)(ii) in any fiscal year if the costs funded by appropriations and allocated for the process for the review of human drug applications—

(i) are not more than 3 percent below the level specified in subparagraph (A)(ii); or

(ii)(I) are more than 3 percent below the level specified in subparagraph (A)(ii), and fees assessed for the fiscal year following the subsequent fiscal year are decreased by the amount in excess of 3 percent by which such costs fell below the level specified in such subparagraph; and

(II) such costs are not more than 5 percent below the level specified in such subparagraph.

#### (C) Provision for early payments ####

Payment of fees authorized under this section for a fiscal year, prior to the due date for such fees, may be accepted by the Secretary in accordance with authority provided in advance in a prior year appropriations Act.

#### (3) Authorization of appropriations ####

For each of the fiscal years 2018 through 2022, there is authorized to be appropriated for fees under this section an amount equal to the total revenue amount determined under subsection (b) for the fiscal year, as adjusted or otherwise affected under subsection (c).

#### (h) Collection of unpaid fees ####

In any case where the Secretary does not receive payment of a fee assessed under subsection (a) within 30 days after it is due, such fee shall be treated as a claim of the United States Government subject to subchapter II of chapter 37 of title 31.

#### (i) Written requests for waivers, reductions, and refunds ####

To qualify for consideration for a waiver or reduction under subsection (d), or for a refund of any fee collected in accordance with subsection (a), a person shall submit to the Secretary a written request for such waiver, reduction, or refund not later than 180 days after such fee is due.

#### (j) Construction ####

This section may not be construed to require that the number of full-time equivalent positions in the Department of Health and Human Services, for officers, employers, and advisory committees not engaged in the process of the review of human drug applications, be reduced to offset the number of officers, employees, and advisory committees so engaged.

#### (k) Orphan drugs ####

#### (1) Exemption ####

(A) The drug meets the public health requirements contained in this chapter as such requirements are applied to requests for waivers for prescription drug program fees.

(B) The drug is owned or licensed and is marketed by a company that had less than $50,000,000 in gross worldwide revenue during the previous year.

#### (2) Evidence of qualification ####
