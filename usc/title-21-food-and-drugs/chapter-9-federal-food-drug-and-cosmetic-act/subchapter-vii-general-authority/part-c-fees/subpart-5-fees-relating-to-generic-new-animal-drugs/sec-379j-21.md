(C) a generic investigational new animal drug file fee of $50,000 for each request or submission described in subsection (a)(4)(A).

#### (2) Inflation adjustment ####

#### (A) In general ####

For fiscal year 2025 and subsequent fiscal years, the revenue amounts established under subsection (b) shall be adjusted by the Secretary by notice, published in the Federal Register, for a fiscal year, by multiplying such revenue amounts by an amount equal to the sum of—

(i) one;

(ii) the average annual percent change in the cost, per full-time equivalent position of the Food and Drug Administration, of all personnel compensation and benefits paid with respect to such positions for the first 3 of the preceding 4 fiscal years for which data are available, multiplied by the average proportion of personnel compensation and benefits costs to total Food and Drug Administration costs for the first 3 of the preceding 4 fiscal years for which data are available; and

(iii) the average annual percent change that occurred in the Consumer Price Index for urban consumers (Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC–MD–VA–WV; not seasonally adjusted; all items less food and energy; annual index) for the first 3 of the preceding 4 years for which data are available multiplied by the average proportion of all costs other than personnel compensation and benefits costs to total Food and Drug Administration costs for the first 3 of the preceding 4 fiscal years for which data are available.

#### (B) Compounded basis ####

The adjustment made each fiscal year after fiscal year 2025 under this paragraph shall be applied on a compounded basis to the revenue amount calculated under this paragraph for the most recent previous fiscal year.

#### (3) Workload adjustments ####

#### (A) In general ####

For fiscal year 2025 and subsequent fiscal years, after the fee revenue amounts established under subsection (b) are adjusted for inflation in accordance with paragraph (2), the fee revenue amounts shall be further adjusted for each such fiscal year to reflect changes in the workload of the Secretary for the process for the review of abbreviated applications for generic new animal drugs, subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C). With respect to such adjustment—

(i) this adjustment shall be determined by the Secretary based on a weighted average of the change in the total number of abbreviated applications for generic new animal drugs, manufacturing supplemental abbreviated applications for generic new animal drugs, investigational generic new animal drug study submissions, investigational generic new animal drug protocol submissions, requests to establish a generic investigational new animal drug file, and generic investigational new animal drug meeting requests submitted to the Secretary;

(ii) if the workload adjustment calculated by the Secretary under clause (i) exceeds 25 percent, the Secretary shall use 25 percent for the adjustment; and

(iii) the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register the fees resulting from this adjustment and the supporting methodologies.

#### (B) Reduction of workload-based increase by amount of certain excess collections ####

For each of fiscal years 2026 through 2028, if application of the workload adjustment under subparagraph (A) increases the fee revenue amounts otherwise established for the fiscal year under subsection (b), as adjusted for inflation under paragraph (2), such fee revenue increase shall be reduced by the amount of any excess collections, as described in subsection (g)(4), for the second preceding fiscal year, up to the amount of such fee revenue increase.

#### (C) Rule of application ####

Under no circumstances shall workload adjustments under this paragraph result in fee revenues for a fiscal year that are less than the fee revenues for that fiscal year established under subsection (b), as adjusted for inflation under paragraph (2).

#### (4) Final year adjustment ####

For fiscal year 2028, the Secretary may, in addition to other adjustments under this subsection, further increase the fees under this section, if such an adjustment is necessary, to provide for up to 3 months of operating reserves of carryover user fees for the process for the review of abbreviated applications for generic new animal drugs for the first 3 months of fiscal year 2029. If the Food and Drug Administration has carryover balances for the process for the review of abbreviated applications for generic new animal drugs in excess of 3 months of such operating reserves, then this adjustment shall not be made. If this adjustment is necessary, then the rationale for the amount of the increase shall be contained in the annual notice setting fees for fiscal year 2028.

#### (5) Limit ####

The total amount of fees charged, as adjusted under this subsection, for a fiscal year may not exceed the total costs for such fiscal year for the resources allocated for the process for the review of abbreviated applications for generic new animal drugs.

#### (d) Fee waiver or reduction ####

The Secretary shall grant a waiver from, or a reduction of, one or more fees assessed under subsection (a) where the Secretary finds that the generic new animal drug is intended solely to provide for a minor use or minor species indication.

#### (e) Effect of failure to pay fees ####

An abbreviated application for a generic new animal drug submitted by a person subject to fees under subsection (a) shall be considered incomplete and shall not be accepted for filing by the Secretary until all fees owed by such person have been paid. An investigational submission for a generic new animal drug that is submitted by a person subject to fees under subsection (a) shall be considered incomplete and shall not be accepted for review by the Secretary until all fees owed by such person have been paid. A request to establish a generic investigational new animal drug file that is submitted by a person subject to fees under subsection (a) shall be considered incomplete and shall not be accepted for action by the Secretary until all fees owed by such person have been paid. The Secretary may discontinue review of any abbreviated application for a generic new animal drug, supplemental abbreviated application for a generic new animal drug, or investigational submission for a generic new animal drug from a person if such person has not submitted for payment all fees owed under this section by 30 days after the date upon which they are due.

#### (f) Assessment of fees ####

#### (1) Limitation ####

Fees may not be assessed under subsection (a) for a fiscal year beginning after fiscal year 2008 unless appropriations for salaries and expenses of the Food and Drug Administration for such fiscal year (excluding the amount of fees appropriated for such fiscal year) are equal to or greater than the amount of appropriations for the salaries and expenses of the Food and Drug Administration for the fiscal year 2003 (excluding the amount of fees appropriated for such fiscal year) multiplied by the adjustment factor applicable to the fiscal year involved.

#### (2) Authority ####

If the Secretary does not assess fees under subsection (a) during any portion of a fiscal year because of paragraph (1) and if at a later date in such fiscal year the Secretary may assess such fees, the Secretary may assess and collect such fees, without any modification in the rate, for abbreviated applications, generic new animal drug products, generic new animal drug sponsors, and generic investigational new animal drug files at any time in such fiscal year notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) relating to the date fees are to be paid.

#### (g) Crediting and availability of fees ####

#### (1) In general ####

Subject to paragraph (2)(C), fees authorized under subsection (a) shall be collected and available for obligation only to the extent and in the amount provided in advance in appropriations Acts. Such fees are authorized to be appropriated to remain available until expended. Such sums as may be necessary may be transferred from the Food and Drug Administration salaries and expenses appropriation account without fiscal year limitation to such appropriation account for salary and expenses with such fiscal year limitation.

#### (B) Compliance ####

The Secretary shall be considered to have met the requirements of subparagraph (A)(ii) in any fiscal year if the costs funded by appropriations and allocated for the process for the review of abbreviated applications for generic new animal drugs—

(i) are not more than 3 percent below the level specified in subparagraph (A)(ii); or

(ii)(I) are more than 3 percent below the level specified in subparagraph (A)(ii), and fees assessed for the fiscal year following the subsequent fiscal year are decreased by the amount in excess of 3 percent by which such costs fell below the level specified in subparagraph (A)(ii); and
