### §356g. Standards for regenerative medicine and regenerative advanced therapies ###

#### (a) In general ####

Not later than 2 years after December 13, 2016, the Secretary, in consultation with the National Institute of Standards and Technology and stakeholders (including regenerative medicine and advanced therapies manufacturers and clinical trial sponsors, contract manufacturers, academic institutions, practicing clinicians, regenerative medicine and advanced therapies industry organizations, and standard setting organizations), shall facilitate an effort to coordinate and prioritize the development of standards and consensus definition of terms, through a public process, to support, through regulatory predictability, the development, evaluation, and review of regenerative medicine therapies and regenerative advanced therapies, including with respect to the manufacturing processes and controls of such products.

#### (b) Activities ####

#### (1) In general ####

In carrying out this section, the Secretary shall continue to—

(A) identity <sup><a href="#356g_1_target" name="356g_1">1</a></sup> opportunities to help advance the development of regenerative medicine therapies and regenerative advanced therapies;

(B) identify opportunities for the development of laboratory regulatory science research and documentary standards that the Secretary determines would help support the development, evaluation, and review of regenerative medicine therapies and regenerative advanced therapies through regulatory predictability; and

(C) work with stakeholders, such as those described in subsection (a), as appropriate, in the development of such standards.

#### (2) Regulations and guidance ####

Not later than 1 year after the development of standards as described in subsection (a), the Secretary shall review relevant regulations and guidance and, through a public process, update such regulations and guidance as the Secretary determines appropriate.

#### (c) Definitions ####

(June 25, 1938, ch. 675, §506G, as added Pub. L. 114–255, div. A, title III, §3036, Dec. 13, 2016, 130 Stat. 1104.)

#### Guidance Regarding Devices Used in the Recovery, Isolation, or Delivery of Regenerative Advanced Therapies ####

Pub. L. 114–255, div. A, title III, §3034, Dec. 13, 2016, 130 Stat. 1103, provided that:

"(a) Draft Guidance.—Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of the 21st Century Cures Act [Dec. 13, 2016], the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, shall issue draft guidance clarifying how, in the context of regenerative advanced therapies, the Secretary will evaluate devices used in the recovery, isolation, or delivery of regenerative advanced therapies. In doing so, the Secretary shall specifically address—

"(1) how the Food and Drug Administration intends to simplify and streamline regulatory requirements for combination device and cell or tissue products;

"(2) what, if any, intended uses or specific attributes would result in a device used with a regenerative therapy product to be classified as a class III device;

"(3) when the Food and Drug Administration considers it is necessary, if ever, for the intended use of a device to be limited to a specific intended use with only one particular type of cell; and

"(4) application of the least burdensome approach to demonstrate how a device may be used with more than one cell type.

"(b) Final Guidance.—Not later than 12 months after the close of the period for public comment on the draft guidance under subsection (a), the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall finalize such guidance."
