#### Effective Medication Guides ####

Pub. L. 104–180, title VI, §601, Aug. 6, 1996, 110 Stat. 1593, provided that:

"(a) In General.—Not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act [Aug. 6, 1996], the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services shall request that national organizations representing health care professionals, consumer organizations, voluntary health agencies, the pharmaceutical industry, drug wholesalers, patient drug information database companies, and other relevant parties collaborate to develop a long-range comprehensive action plan to achieve goals consistent with the goals of the proposed rule of the Food and Drug Administration on 'Prescription Drug Product Labeling: Medication Guide Requirements' (60 Fed. Reg. 44182; relating to the provision of oral and written prescription information to consumers).

"(b) Goals.—Goals consistent with the proposed rule described in subsection (a) are the distribution of useful written information to 75 percent of individuals receiving new precriptions [sic] by the year 2000 and to 95 percent by the year 2006.

"(c) Plan.—The plan described in subsection (a) shall—

"(1) identify the plan goals;

"(2) assess the effectiveness of the current private-sector approaches used to provide oral and written prescription information to consumers;

"(3) develop guidelines for providing effective oral and written prescription information consistent with the findings of any such assessment;

"(4) contain elements necessary to ensure the transmittal of useful information to the consuming public, including being scientifically accurate, non-promotional in tone and content, sufficiently specific and comprehensive as to adequately inform consumers about the use of the product, and in an understandable, legible format that is readily comprehensible and not confusing to consumers expected to use the product.[;]

"(5) develop a mechanism to assess periodically the quality of the oral and written prescription information and the frequency with which the information is provided to consumers; and

"(6) provide for compliance with relevant State board regulations.

"(d) Limitation on the Authority of the Secretary.—The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services shall have no authority to implement the proposed rule described in subsection (a), or to develop any similar regulation, policy statement, or other guideline specifying a uniform content or format for written information voluntarily provided to consumers about prescription drugs if, (1) not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act [Aug. 6, 1996], the national organizations described in subsection (a) develop and submit to the Secretary for Health and Human Services a comprehensive, long-range action plan (as described in subsection (a)) which shall be acceptable to the Secretary of Health and Human Services; (2) the aforementioned plan is submitted to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for review and acceptance: *Provided*, That the Secretary shall give due consideration to the submitted plan and that any such acceptance shall not be arbitrarily withheld; and (3) the implementation of (a) a plan accepted by the Secretary commences within 30 days of the Secretary's acceptance of such plan, or (b) the plan submitted to the Secretary commences within 60 days of the submission of such plan if the Secretary fails to take any action on the plan within 30 days of the submission of the plan. The Secretary shall accept, reject or suggest modifications to the plan submitted within 30 days of its submission. The Secretary may confer with and assist private parties in the development of the plan described in subsections (a) and (b).

"(e) Secretary Review.—Not later than January 1, 2001, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services shall review the status of private-sector initiatives designed to achieve the goals of the plan described in subsection (a), and if such goals are not achieved, the limitation in subsection (d) shall not apply, and the Secretary shall seek public comment on other initiatives that may be carried out to meet such goals."

#### Congressional Findings ####

Pub. L. 100–293, §2, Apr. 22, 1988, 102 Stat. 95, provided that: "The Congress finds the following:

"(1) American consumers cannot purchase prescription drugs with the certainty that the products are safe and effective.

"(2) The integrity of the distribution system for prescription drugs is insufficient to prevent the introduction and eventual retail sale of substandard, ineffective, or even counterfeit drugs.

"(3) The existence and operation of a wholesale submarket, commonly known as the 'diversion market', prevents effective control over or even routine knowledge of the true sources of prescription drugs in a significant number of cases.

"(4) Large amounts of drugs are being reimported to the United States as American goods returned. These imports are a health and safety risk to American consumers because they may have become subpotent or adulterated during foreign handling and shipping.

"(5) The ready market for prescription drug reimports has been the catalyst for a continuing series of frauds against American manufacturers and has provided the cover for the importation of foreign counterfeit drugs.

"(6) The existing system of providing drug samples to physicians through manufacturer's representatives has been abused for decades and has resulted in the sale to consumers of misbranded, expired, and adulterated pharmaceuticals.

"(7) The bulk resale of below wholesale priced prescription drugs by health care entities, for ultimate sale at retail, helps fuel the diversion market and is an unfair form of competition to wholesalers and retailers that must pay otherwise prevailing market prices.

"(8) The effect of these several practices and conditions is to create an unacceptable risk that counterfeit, adulterated, misbranded, subpotent, or expired drugs will be sold to American consumers."
