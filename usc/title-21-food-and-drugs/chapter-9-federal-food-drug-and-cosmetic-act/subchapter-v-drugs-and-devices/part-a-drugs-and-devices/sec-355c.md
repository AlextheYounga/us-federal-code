### §355c. Research into pediatric uses for drugs and biological products ###

#### (a) New drugs and biological products ####

#### (1) In general ####

#### (A) General requirements ####

Except with respect to an application for which subparagraph (B) applies, a person that submits, on or after September 27, 2007, an application (or supplement to an application) for a drug—

(i) under section 355 of this title for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration; or

(ii) under section 262 of title 42 for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration,

shall submit with the application the assessments described in paragraph (2).

#### (B) Certain molecularly targeted cancer indications ####

A person that submits, on or after the date that is 3 years after August 18, 2017, an original application for a new active ingredient under section 355 of this title or section 262 of title 42, shall submit with the application reports on the investigation described in paragraph (3) if the drug or biological product that is the subject of the application is—

(i) intended for the treatment of an adult cancer; and

(ii) directed at a molecular target that the Secretary determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer.

#### (2) Assessments ####

#### (A) In general ####

The assessments referred to in paragraph (1)(A) shall contain data, gathered using appropriate formulations for each age group for which the assessment is required, that are adequate—

(i) to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations; and

(ii) to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug or the biological product is safe and effective.

#### (B) Similar course of disease or similar effect of drug or biological product ####

#### (i) In general ####

If the course of the disease and the effects of the drug are sufficiently similar in adults and pediatric patients, the Secretary may conclude that pediatric effectiveness can be extrapolated from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults, usually supplemented with other information obtained in pediatric patients, such as pharmacokinetic studies.

#### (ii) Extrapolation between age groups ####

A study may not be needed in each pediatric age group if data from one age group can be extrapolated to another age group.

#### (iii) Information on extrapolation ####

A brief documentation of the scientific data supporting the conclusion under clauses (i) and (ii) shall be included in any pertinent reviews for the application under section 355 of this title or section 262 of title 42.

#### (3) Molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigation ####

#### (A) In general ####

With respect to a drug or biological product described in paragraph (1)(B), the investigation described in this paragraph is a molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigation, which shall be designed to yield clinically meaningful pediatric study data, gathered using appropriate formulations for each age group for which the study is required, regarding dosing, safety, and preliminary efficacy to inform potential pediatric labeling.

#### (B) Extrapolation of data ####

Paragraph (2)(B) shall apply to investigations described in this paragraph to the same extent and in the same manner as paragraph (2)(B) applies with respect to the assessments required under paragraph (1)(A).

#### (C) Deferrals and waivers ####

Deferrals and waivers under paragraphs (4) and (5) shall apply to investigations described in this paragraph to the same extent and in the same manner as such deferrals and waivers apply with respect to the assessments under paragraph (2)(B).

#### (4) Deferral ####

#### (A) In general ####

On the initiative of the Secretary or at the request of the applicant, the Secretary may defer submission of some or all assessments required under paragraph (1)(A) or reports on the investigation required under paragraph (1)(B) until a specified date after approval of the drug or issuance of the license for a biological product if—

(i) the Secretary finds that—

(I) the drug or biological product is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete;

(II) pediatric studies should be delayed until additional safety or effectiveness data have been collected; or

(III) there is another appropriate reason for deferral; and

(ii) the applicant submits to the Secretary—

(I) certification of the grounds for deferring the assessments or reports on the investigation;

(II) a pediatric study plan as described in subsection (e);

(III) evidence that the studies are being conducted or will be conducted with due diligence and at the earliest possible time; and

(IV) a timeline for the completion of such studies.

#### (B) Deferral extension ####

#### (i) In general ####

On the initiative of the Secretary or at the request of the applicant, the Secretary may grant an extension of a deferral approved under subparagraph (A) for submission of some or all assessments required under paragraph (1)(A) or reports on the investigation required under paragraph (1)(B) if—

(I) the Secretary determines that the conditions described in subclause (II) or (III) of subparagraph (A)(i) continue to be met; and

(II) the applicant submits a new timeline under subparagraph (A)(ii)(IV) and any significant updates to the information required under subparagraph (A)(ii).

#### (ii) Timing and information ####

Nothing in this subsection alters or amends section 331(j) of this title or section 552 of title 5 or section 1905 of title 18.

#### (c) Meaningful therapeutic benefit ####

For the purposes of paragraph (4)(A)(iii)(I) and (4)(B)(iii)(I) of subsection (a) and paragraphs (1)(B) and (2)(B)(iii)(I)(aa) of subsection (b), a drug or biological product shall be considered to represent a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing therapies if the Secretary determines that—

(1) if approved, the drug or biological product could represent an improvement in the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a disease, compared with marketed products adequately labeled for that use in the relevant pediatric population; or

(2) the drug or biological product is in a class of products or for an indication for which there is a need for additional options.

#### (d) Submission of assessments and reports on the investigation ####

If a person fails to submit a required assessment described in subsection (a)(2) or the investigation described in subsection (a)(3), fails to meet the applicable requirements in subsection (a)(4), or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation described in subsection (a) or (b), in accordance with applicable provisions of subsections (a) and (b), the following shall apply:

(1) Beginning 270 days after July 9, 2012, the Secretary shall issue a non-compliance letter to such person informing them of such failure to submit or meet the requirements of the applicable subsection. Such letter shall require the person to respond in writing within 45 calendar days of issuance of such letter. Such response may include the person's request for a deferral extension if applicable. Such letter and the person's written response to such letter shall be made publicly available on the Internet Web site of the Food and Drug Administration 60 calendar days after issuance, with redactions for any trade secrets and confidential commercial information. If the Secretary determines that the letter was issued in error, the requirements of this paragraph shall not apply. The Secretary shall inform the Pediatric Advisory Committee of letters issued under this paragraph and responses to such letters.

(2) The drug or biological product that is the subject of an assessment described in subsection (a)(2) or the investigation described in subsection (a)(3), applicable requirements in subsection (a)(4), or request for approval of a pediatric formulation, may be considered misbranded solely because of that failure and subject to relevant enforcement action (except that the drug or biological product shall not be subject to action under section 333 of this title), but such failure shall not be the basis for a proceeding—

(A) to withdraw approval for a drug under section 355(e) of this title; or
