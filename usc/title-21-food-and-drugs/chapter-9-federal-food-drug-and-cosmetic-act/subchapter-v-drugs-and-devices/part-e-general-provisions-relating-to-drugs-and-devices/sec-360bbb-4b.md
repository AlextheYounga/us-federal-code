#### (1) In general ####

A person may submit data and information in a master file to the Secretary with the intent to reference, or to authorize, in writing, another person to reference, such data or information to support a medical countermeasure submission (including a supplement or amendment to any such submission), without requiring the master file holder to disclose the data and information to any such persons authorized to reference the master file. Such data and information shall be available for reference by the master file holder or by a person authorized by the master file holder, in accordance with applicable privacy and confidentiality protocols and regulations.

#### (2) Reference of certain master files ####

In the case that data or information within a medical countermeasure master file is used only to support the conditional approval of an application filed under section 360ccc of this title, such master file may be relied upon to support the effectiveness of a product that is the subject of a subsequent medical countermeasure submission only if such application is supplemented by additional data or information to support review and approval in a manner consistent with the standards applicable to such review and approval for such countermeasure, qualified countermeasure, or qualified pandemic or epidemic product.

#### (b) Medical countermeasure master file content ####

#### (1) In general ####

A master file under this section may include data or information to support—

#### (2) Required updates ####

The Secretary may require, as appropriate, that the master file holder ensure that the contents of such master file are updated during the time such master file is referenced for a medical countermeasure submission.

#### (c) Sponsor reference ####

#### (1) In general ####

Each incorporation of data or information within a medical countermeasure master file shall describe the incorporated material in a manner in which the Secretary determines appropriate and that permits the review of such information within such master file without necessitating resubmission of such data or information. Master files shall be submitted in an electronic format in accordance with sections 360b(b)(4), 360ccc(a)(4), and 379k–1 of this title, as applicable, and as specified in applicable guidance.

#### (2) Reference by a master file holder ####

A master file holder that is the sponsor of a medical countermeasure submission shall notify the Secretary in writing of the intent to reference the medical countermeasure master file as a part of the submission.

#### (3) Reference by an authorized person ####

A person submitting an application for review may, where the Secretary determines appropriate, incorporate by reference all or part of the contents of a medical countermeasure master file, if the master file holder authorizes the incorporation in writing.

#### (d) Acknowledgment of and reliance upon a master file by the Secretary ####

#### (1) In general ####

The Secretary shall provide the master file holder with a written notification indicating that the Secretary has reviewed and relied upon specified data or information within a master file and the purposes for which such data or information was incorporated by reference if the Secretary has reviewed and relied upon such specified data or information to support the approval, classification, conditional approval, clearance, licensure, or authorization of a security countermeasure, qualified countermeasure, or qualified pandemic or epidemic product. The Secretary may rely upon the data and information within the medical countermeasure master file for which such written notification was provided in additional applications, as applicable and appropriate and upon the request of the master file holder so notified in writing or by an authorized person of such holder.

#### (2) Certain applications ####

If the Secretary has reviewed and relied upon specified data or information within a medical countermeasure master file to support the conditional approval of an application under section 360ccc of this title to subsequently support the approval, clearance, licensure, or authorization of a security countermeasure, qualified countermeasure, or qualified pandemic or epidemic product, the Secretary shall provide a brief written description to the master file holder regarding the elements of the application fulfilled by the data or information within the master file and how such data or information contained in such application meets the standards of evidence under subsection (c) or (d) of section 355 of this title, subsection (d) of section 360b of this title, or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 262] (as applicable), which shall not include any trade secret or confidential commercial information.
