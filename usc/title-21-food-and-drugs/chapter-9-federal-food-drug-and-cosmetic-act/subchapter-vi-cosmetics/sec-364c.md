#### (f) Suspensions ####

#### (1) Suspension of registration of a facility ####

The Secretary may suspend the registration of a facility if the Secretary determines that a cosmetic product manufactured or processed by a registered facility and distributed in the United States has a reasonable probability of causing serious adverse health consequences or death to humans and the Secretary has a reasonable belief that other products manufactured or processed by the facility may be similarly affected because of a failure that cannot be isolated to a product or products, or is sufficiently pervasive to raise concerns about other products manufactured in the facility.

Before suspending a facility registration under this section, the Secretary shall provide—

(A) notice to the facility registrant of the cosmetic product or other responsible person, as appropriate, of the intent to suspend the facility registration, which shall specify the basis of the determination by the Secretary that the facility registration should be suspended; and

The Secretary shall provide the registrant subject to an order under paragraph (1) or (2) with an opportunity for an informal hearing, to be held as soon as possible but not later than 5 business days after the issuance of the order, or such other time period agreed upon by the Secretary and the registrant, on the actions required for reinstatement of registration and why the registration that is subject to the suspension should be reinstated. The Secretary shall reinstate a registration if the Secretary determines, based on evidence presented, that adequate grounds do not exist to continue the suspension of the registration.

#### (4) Post-hearing corrective action plan ####

If, after providing opportunity for an informal hearing under paragraph (3), the Secretary determines that the suspension of registration remains necessary, the Secretary shall require the registrant to submit a corrective action plan to demonstrate how the registrant plans to correct the conditions found by the Secretary. The Secretary shall review such plan not later than 14 business days after the submission of the corrective action plan or such other time period as determined by the Secretary, in consultation with the registrant.
