(2) it is imperative that the People's Republic of China follow through on full implementation of the new regulations, adopted May 1, 2019, to treat all fentanyl analogues as controlled substances under the laws of the People's Republic of China, including by devoting sufficient resources for implementation and strict enforcement of the new regulations; and
