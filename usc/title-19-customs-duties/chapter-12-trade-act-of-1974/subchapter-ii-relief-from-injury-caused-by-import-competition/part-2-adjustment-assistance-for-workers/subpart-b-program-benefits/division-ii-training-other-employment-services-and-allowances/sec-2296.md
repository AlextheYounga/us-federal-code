(ii) are reimbursable under any other provision of Federal law and a portion of such costs have already been paid under such other provision of Federal law.

(C) The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to, or take into account, any funds provided under any other provision of Federal law which are used for any purpose other than the direct payment of the costs incurred in training a particular adversely affected worker, even if such use has the effect of indirectly paying or reducing any portion of the costs involved in training the adversely affected worker.

(7) The Secretary shall not approve a training program if—

(A) all or a portion of the costs of such training program are paid under any nongovernmental plan or program,

(B) the adversely affected worker has a right to obtain training or funds for training under such plan or program, and

(C) such plan or program requires the worker to reimburse the plan or program from funds provided under this part, or from wages paid under such training program, for any portion of the costs of such training program paid under the plan or program.

(8) The Secretary may approve training for any adversely affected worker who is a member of a group certified under subpart A at any time after the date on which the group is certified under subpart A, without regard to whether such worker has exhausted all rights to any unemployment insurance to which the worker is entitled.

#### (d) Eligibility for unemployment insurance ####

A worker may not be determined to be ineligible or disqualified for unemployment insurance or program benefits under this subpart because the individual is in training approved under subsection (a), because of leaving work which is not suitable employment to enter such training, or because of the application to any such week in training of provisions of State law or Federal unemployment insurance law relating to availability for work, active search for work, or refusal to accept work. The Secretary shall submit to the Congress a quarterly report regarding the amount of funds expended during the quarter concerned to provide training under subsection (a) and the anticipated demand for such funds for any remaining quarters in the fiscal year concerned.
