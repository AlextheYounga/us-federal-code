Pub. L. 109–162, title VII, §701, Jan. 5, 2006, 119 Stat. 3052, which directed that subtitle N of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (part L of this subchapter) be amended by adding at the end a subtitle O consisting of section 41501 (34 U.S.C. 12501), is reflected in the Code by setting out subtitle O as a separate part M (this part) and not as included in part L of this subchapter, as the probable intent of Congress.
