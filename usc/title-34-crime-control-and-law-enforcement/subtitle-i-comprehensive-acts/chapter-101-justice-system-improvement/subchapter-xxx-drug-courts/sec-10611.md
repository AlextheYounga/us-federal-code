Economic sanctions imposed on an offender pursuant to this section shall not be at a level that would interfere with the offender's rehabilitation.

#### (c) Mandatory drug testing and mandatory sanctions ####

#### (1) Mandatory testing ####

Grant amounts under this subchapter may be used for a drug court only if the drug court has mandatory periodic testing as described in subsection (a)(3)(A).

#### (2) Mandatory sanctions ####

The Attorney General shall, by prescribing guidelines or regulations, specify that grant amounts under this subchapter may be used for a drug court only if the drug court imposes graduated sanctions that increase punitive measures, therapeutic measures, or both whenever a participant fails a drug test.
