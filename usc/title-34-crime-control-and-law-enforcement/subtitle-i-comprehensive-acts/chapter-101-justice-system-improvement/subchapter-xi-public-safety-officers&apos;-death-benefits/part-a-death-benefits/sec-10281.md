#### (b) Benefits for permanent and total disability ####

In accordance with regulations issued pursuant to this subchapter, in any case in which the Bureau determines that a public safety officer has become permanently and totally disabled as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty, a benefit shall be payable to the public safety officer (if living on the date on which the determination is made) in the same amount that would be payable, as of the date such injury was sustained (including as adjusted in accordance with subsection (h), and calculated in accordance with subsection (i)), if such determination were a determination under subsection (a): *Provided*, That for the purposes of making these benefit payments, there are authorized to be appropriated for each fiscal year such sums as may be necessary.

#### (c) Interim benefit payment ####

Whenever the Bureau determines upon showing of need and prior to final action that the death of a public safety officer is one with respect to which a benefit will probably be paid, the Bureau may make an interim benefit payment not exceeding $6,000, adjusted in accordance with subsection (h), to the individual entitled to receive a benefit under subsection (a) of this section.

#### (d) Deduction of interim payment ####

The amount of an interim payment under subsection (c) shall be deducted from the amount of any final benefit paid to such individual.

#### (e) Repayment of interim payment; waiver ####

Where there is no final benefit paid, the recipient of any interim payment under subsection (c) shall be liable for repayment of such amount. The Bureau may waive all or part of such repayment, considering for this purpose the hardship which would result from such repayment.

#### (f) Reductions from final benefit payment ####

The benefit payable under this subchapter shall be in addition to any other benefit that may be due from any other source, except—

(1) payments authorized by section 12(k) of the Act of September 1, 1916;

#### (i) Amount payable ####

The amount payable under subsections (a) and (b), with respect to the death or permanent and total disability of a public safety officer, shall be the greater of—

(1) the amount payable under the relevant subsection as of the date of death or of the catastrophic injury of the public safety officer; or

(2) in any case in which the claim filed thereunder has been pending for more than 365 days at the time of final determination by the Bureau, the amount that would be payable under the relevant subsection if the death or the catastrophic injury of the public safety officer had occurred on the date on which the Bureau makes such final determination.

(2) No benefit is payable under this subchapter with respect to the disability of a public safety officer if a benefit is payable under this subchapter with respect to the death of such public safety officer.

#### (k) Death by heart attack, stroke, or vascular rupture; presumption ####

As determined by the Bureau, a heart attack, stroke, or vascular rupture suffered by a public safety officer shall be presumed to constitute a personal injury within the meaning of subsection (a), sustained in the line of duty by the officer and directly and proximately resulting in death, if—

(1) the public safety officer, while on duty—

(A) engages in a situation involving nonroutine stressful or strenuous physical law enforcement, fire suppression, rescue, hazardous material response, emergency medical services, prison security, disaster relief, or other emergency response activity; or

(B) participates in a training exercise involving nonroutine stressful or strenuous physical activity;

(2) the heart attack, stroke, or vascular rupture commences—

(A) while the officer is engaged or participating as described in paragraph (1);

(B) while the officer remains on that duty after being engaged or participating as described in paragraph (1); or

(C) not later than 24 hours after the officer is engaged or participating as described in paragraph (1); and

(3) the heart attack, stroke, or vascular rupture directly and proximately results in the death of the public safety officer,

unless competent medical evidence establishes that the heart attack, stroke, or vascular rupture was unrelated to the engagement or participation or was directly and proximately caused by something other than the mere presence of cardiovascular-disease risk factors.

#### (l) Definition ####

For purposes of subsection (k), "nonroutine stressful or strenuous physical" excludes actions of a clerical, administrative, or nonmanual nature.

#### (m) Suspension or end of collection action ####

The Bureau may suspend or end collection action on an amount disbursed pursuant to a statute enacted retroactively or otherwise disbursed in error under subsection (a), (b), or (c), where such collection would be impractical, or would cause undue hardship to a debtor who acted in good faith.

#### (n) Confidentiality ####

The public safety agency, organization, or unit responsible for maintaining on file an executed designation of beneficiary or executed life insurance policy for purposes of subsection (a)(4) shall maintain the confidentiality of the designation or policy in the same manner as the agency, organization, or unit maintains personnel or other similar records of the public safety officer.

#### Findings ####

Pub. L. 117–172, §2, Aug. 16, 2022, 136 Stat. 2098, provided that: "Congress finds the following:

"(1) Every day, public safety officers, including police officers, firefighters, emergency medical technicians, and others, work to maintain the safety, health, and well-being of the communities they serve.

"(2) This means public safety officers are routinely called to respond to stressful and potentially traumatic situations, often putting their own lives in danger.

"(3) This work not only puts public safety officers at-risk for experiencing harm, serious injury, and cumulative and acute trauma, but also places them at up to 25.6 times higher risk for developing post-traumatic stress disorder when compared to individuals without such experiences.

"(4) Psychological evidence indicates that law enforcement officers experience significant job-related stressors and exposures that may confer increased risk for mental health morbidities (such as post-traumatic stress disorder and suicidal thoughts, ideation, intents, and behaviors) and hastened mortality.

"(5) Public safety officers often do not have the resources or support they need, leaving them at higher risk for long-term mental health consequences.

"(6) Whereas, although the Department of Defense already considers servicemember suicides to be line-of-duty deaths and provides Federal support to eligible surviving families, the Federal Government does not recognize public safety officer suicides as deaths in the line of duty.

"(7) In 2017, the Department of Justice approved 481 claims under the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program under subpart 1 of part L of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10281 et seq.), but not one of them for the more than 240 public safety officers who died by suicide that year.

"(8) Public safety officers who have died or are disabled as a result of suicide or post-traumatic stress disorder do not qualify for the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program, despite the fact that public safety officers are more likely to die by suicide than from any other line-of-duty cause of death."

#### Safeguarding America's First Responders ####

Pub. L. 116–157, Aug. 14, 2020, 134 Stat. 704, as amended by Pub. L. 117–61, §9, Nov. 18, 2021, 135 Stat. 1481, provided that:

#### "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. ####

"This Act may be cited as the 'Safeguarding America's First Responders Act of 2020'.

#### "SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS; PURPOSE. ####

"(a) Sense of Congress.—It is the sense of Congress that—

"(1) an infectious disease pandemic known as COVID–19 exists;

"(2) to date, there is much still unknown about COVID–19, but it is known that COVID–19 and related complications may be fatal;

"(3) services provided by public safety officers are nonetheless essential during this pandemic;

"(4) due to the COVID–19 pandemic and what is currently known about how the disease is spread, public safety officers are uncharacteristically at risk of contracting the disease; and

"(5) although the Public Safety Officers' Benefits program currently covers deaths and permanent and total disabilities resulting from infectious disease sustained by public safety officers in carrying out their duties, the determination of claims involving personal injuries believed to have resulted from COVID–19 or its complications may be uniquely challenging or delayed given the lack of—

"(A) definitive testing and medical records at this time; and

"(B) a definitive uniform body of medical information about how the disease is spread or its effects.

"(b) Purpose.—The purpose of this Act is to establish a carefully drawn framework wherein claims under the Public Safety Officers' Benefits program, arising under the unique circumstances described in subsection (a), can be processed expeditiously and under fair and clear standards.

#### "SEC. 3. PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICER BENEFITS. ####

"(a) Death Benefits.—As determined by the Bureau of Justice Assistance, unless competent medical evidence establishes that the death of a public safety officer (as defined in section 1204 of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10284)) was directly and proximately caused by something other than COVID–19, COVID–19 (or complications therefrom) suffered by the public safety officer shall be presumed to constitute a personal injury within the meaning of section 1201(a) of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10281(a)), sustained in the line of duty by the officer and directly and proximately resulting in death, if—

"(1) the officer engaged in a line of duty action or activity during the period beginning on January 1, 2020, and ending on the termination date;

"(2) the officer was diagnosed with COVID–19 (or evidence indicates that the officer had COVID–19) during the 45-day period beginning on the last day of duty of the officer; and

"(3) evidence indicates that the officer had COVID–19 (or complications therefrom) at the time of the officer's death.

"(b) Disability Benefits.—As determined by the Bureau of Justice Assistance, COVID–19 (or complications therefrom) suffered by a public safety officer shall be presumed to constitute a personal injury within the meaning of section 1201(b) of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10281(b)), sustained in the line of duty by the officer, if—

"(1) the officer engaged in a line of duty action or activity during the period beginning on January 1, 2020, and ending on the termination date; and

"(2) the officer was diagnosed with COVID–19 (or evidence indicates that the officer had COVID–19) during the 45-day period beginning on the last day of duty of the officer.

"(c) Termination Date.—For purposes of this section, the term 'termination date' means the earlier of—

"(1) the date on which the public health emergency declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services under section 319 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247d) on January 31, 2020, with respect to the Coronavirus Disease (COVID–19), expires; and

"(2) December 31, 2023."
