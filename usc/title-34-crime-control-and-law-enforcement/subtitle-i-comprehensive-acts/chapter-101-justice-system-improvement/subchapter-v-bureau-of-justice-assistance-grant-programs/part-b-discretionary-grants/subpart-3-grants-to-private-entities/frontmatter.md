#### **Editorial Notes** ####

#### Codification ####

Pub. L. 109–248, title VI, §626, July 27, 2006, 120 Stat. 636, which directed amendment of "subpart 2 of part E of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Street Act of 1968" by adding chapter 4 at end, was treated as meaning chapter D, which was changed to subpart 4 for purposes of codification, to reflect the probable intent of Congress. Subpart 4 was subsequently editorially reclassified as subpart 3 of part B of subchapter V of this chapter.
