#### **Editorial Notes** ####

#### References in Text ####

Section 50104 of this title, referred to in subsec. (a), was in the original a reference to "section 554", and was translated as if it had been a reference to section 609P of Pub. L. 98–473, which is classified to section 50104 of this title to reflect the probable intent of Congress as manifested in earlier versions of Emergency Federal Law Enforcement Assistance provisions introduced in the Congress. Pub. L. 98–473 does not contain a section 554.

#### Codification ####

Section was formerly classified to section 10507 of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare, prior to editorial reclassification and renumbering as this section.
