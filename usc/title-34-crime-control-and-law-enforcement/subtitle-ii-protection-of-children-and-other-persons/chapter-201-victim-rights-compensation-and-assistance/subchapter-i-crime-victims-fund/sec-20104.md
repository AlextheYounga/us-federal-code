Section 5106c of title 42, referred to in text, was in the original "section 109 of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act", meaning section 109 of Pub. L. 93–247, and was translated as reading section 107 of that act to reflect the probable intent of Congress and the renumbering of section 109 as section 107 by section 113(a)(1)(B) of Pub. L. 104–235, title I, Oct. 3, 1996, 110 Stat. 3079.
