Section 7105(c)(4) of title 22, referred to in text, was in the original "section 105(c)(4) of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000" and was translated as if it read "section 107(c)(4)" of the Act to reflect the probable intent of Congress. There is no section 105(c)(4) of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 and section 107(c)(4) relates to the training of Government personnel.
