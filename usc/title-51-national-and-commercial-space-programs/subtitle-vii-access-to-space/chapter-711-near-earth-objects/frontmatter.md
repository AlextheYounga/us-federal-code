"(2) Section 321(d)(1) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2005 (Public Law 109–155; 119 Stat. 2922; 51 U.S.C. 71101 note prec.) [set out below], established a requirement that the Administrator [of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration] plan, develop, and implement a Near-Earth Object Survey program to detect, track, catalogue, and characterize the physical characteristics of near-Earth objects equal to, or greater than, 140 meters in diameter in order to assess the threat of such near-Earth objects to the Earth, with the goal of 90 percent completion of the catalogue of such near-Earth objects by December 30, 2020.

"(3) The goal described in paragraph (2) has not be met.

"(4) The report of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine entitled 'Finding Hazardous Asteroids Using Infrared and Visible Wavelength Telescopes', issued in 2019, states that—

"(A) NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] should develop and launch a dedicated space-based infrared survey telescope to meet the requirements of section 321(d)(1) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2005 (Public Law 109–155; 119 Stat. 2922; 51 U.S.C. 71101 note prec.); and

"(B) the early detection of potentially hazardous near-Earth objects enabled by a space-based infrared survey telescope is important to enable deflection of a dangerous asteroid.

"(b) Maintenance of Planetary Defense Coordination Office.—The Administrator shall maintain an office within the Planetary Science Division of the Science Mission Directorate, to be known as the 'Planetary Defense Coordination Office'—

"(1) to plan, develop, and implement a program to survey threats posed by near-Earth objects equal to or greater than 140 meters in diameter, as required by section 321(d)(1) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2005 (Public Law 109–155; 119 Stat. 2922; 51 U.S.C. 71101 note prec.);

"(2) identify, track, and characterize potentially hazardous near-Earth objects, issue warnings of the effects of potential impacts of such objects, and investigate strategies and technologies for mitigating the potential impacts of such objects; and

"(3) assist in coordinating government planning for response to a potential impact of a near-Earth object.

"(c) Dedicated Survey Mission.—

"(1) Sense of congress.—It is the sense of Congress that—

"(A) the Near-Earth Object Surveyor mission, as designed, is anticipated to make significant progress toward carrying out congressional policy and direction, as set forth in section 321(d)(1) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2005 (Public Law 109–155; 119 Stat. 2922; 51 U.S.C. 71101 note prec.), to detect 90 percent of near-Earth objects equal to, or greater than, 140 meters in diameter; and

"(B) the Administrator should prioritize the public safety role of the Near-Earth Object Surveyor mission and should not delay the development and launch of the mission due to cost growth on other planetary science missions.

"(2) Continuation of mission.—

"(A) In general.—The Administrator shall continue the development of a dedicated space-based infrared survey telescope mission, known as the 'Near-Earth Object Surveyor', on a schedule to achieve a launch-readiness date not later than March 30, 2026, or the earliest practicable date, for the purpose of accomplishing the objectives set forth in section 321(d)(1) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2005 (Public Law 109–155; 119 Stat. 2922; 51 U.S.C. 71101 note prec.).

"(d) Annual Report.—[Amended section 321(f) of Pub. L. 109–155, set out below.]

"(e) Near-earth Object Defined.—In this section, the term 'near-Earth object' has the meaning given the term in section 321(c) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2005 (Public Law 109–155; 119 Stat. 2922; 51 U.S.C. 71101 note prec.)."

#### George E. Brown, Jr. Near-Earth Object Survey ####

Pub. L. 109–155, title III, §321, Dec. 30, 2005, 119 Stat. 2922, as amended by Pub. L. 115–10, title V, §511, Mar. 21, 2017, 131 Stat. 51; Pub. L. 117–167, div. B, title VII, §10825(d), Aug. 9, 2022, 136 Stat. 1745, provided that:

"(a) Short Title.—This section may be cited as the 'George E. Brown, Jr. Near-Earth Object Survey Act'.

"(b) Findings.—The Congress makes the following findings:

"(1) Near-Earth objects pose a serious and credible threat to humankind, as many scientists believe that a major asteroid or comet was responsible for the mass extinction of the majority of the Earth's species, including the dinosaurs, nearly 65,000,000 years ago.

"(2) Similar objects have struck the Earth or passed through the Earth's atmosphere several times in the Earth's history and pose a similar threat in the future.

"(3) Several such near-Earth objects have only been discovered within days of the objects' closest approach to Earth, and recent discoveries of such large objects indicate that many large near-Earth objects remain undiscovered.

"(4) The efforts taken to date by NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] for detecting and characterizing the hazards of near-Earth objects are not sufficient to fully determine the threat posed by such objects to cause widespread destruction and loss of life.

"(c) Definitions.—For purposes of this section the term 'near-Earth object' means an asteroid or comet with a perihelion distance of less than 1.3 Astronomical Units from the Sun.

"(d) Near-Earth Object Survey.—

"(1) Survey program.—The Administrator [of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration] shall plan, develop, and implement a Near-Earth Object Survey program to detect, track, catalogue, and characterize the physical characteristics of near-Earth objects equal to or greater than 140 meters in diameter in order to assess the threat of such near-Earth objects to the Earth. It shall be the goal of the Survey program to achieve 90 percent completion of its near-Earth object catalogue (based on statistically predicted populations of near-Earth objects) within 15 years after the date of enactment of this Act [Dec. 30, 2005].

"(2) [Amended former section 2451 of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare.]

"(3) Fifth-year report.—The Administrator shall transmit to the Congress, not later than February 28 of the fifth year after the date of enactment of this Act, a report that provides the following:
