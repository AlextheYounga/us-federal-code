"(a) Sense of Congress.—It is the sense of Congress that—

"(1) the [National Aeronautics and Space] Administration must address, mitigate, and reverse, where possible, the deterioration of its facilities and infrastructure, as their condition is hampering the effectiveness and efficiency of research performed by both the Administration and industry participants making use of Administration facilities, thus harming the competitiveness of the United States aerospace industry;

"(2) the Administration has a role in providing laboratory capabilities to industry participants that are not economically viable as commercial entities and thus are not available elsewhere;

"(3) to ensure continued access to reliable and efficient world-class facilities by researchers, the Administration should establish strategic partnerships with other Federal agencies, State agencies, FAA-licensed spaceports, institutions of higher education, and industry, as appropriate; and

"(4) decisions on whether to dispose of, maintain, or modernize existing facilities must be made in the context of meeting Administration and other needs, including those required to meet the activities supporting the human exploration roadmap under section 432 of this Act [set out in a note under section 20302 of this title], considering other national laboratory needs as the Administrator [of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration] deems appropriate.

"(b) Policy.—It is the policy of the United States that the Administration maintain reliable and efficient facilities and infrastructure and that decisions on whether to dispose of, maintain, or modernize existing facilities or infrastructure be made in the context of meeting future Administration needs.

"(c) Plan.—

"(1) In general.—The Administrator shall develop a facilities and infrastructure plan.

"(2) Goal.—The goal of the plan is to position the Administration to have the facilities and infrastructure, including laboratories, tools, and approaches, necessary to meet future Administration and other Federal agencies' laboratory needs.

"(3) Contents.—The plan shall identify—

"(A) current Administration and other Federal agency laboratory needs;

"(B) future Administration research and development and testing needs;

"(C) a strategy for identifying facilities and infrastructure that are candidates for disposal, that is consistent with the national strategic direction set forth in—

"(i) the National Space Policy;

"(ii) the National Aeronautics Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation Infrastructure Plan;

"(iii) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2005 (Public Law 109–155; 119 Stat. 2895) [see Tables for classification], National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2008 (Public Law 110–422; 122 Stat. 4779) [see Tables for classification], and National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.C. 18301 et seq.); and

"(iv) the human exploration roadmap under section 432 of this Act [set out in a note under section 20302 of this title];

"(D) a strategy for the maintenance, repair, upgrading, and modernization of Administration facilities and infrastructure, including laboratories and equipment;

"(E) criteria for—

"(i) prioritizing deferred maintenance tasks;

"(ii) maintaining, repairing, upgrading, or modernizing Administration facilities and infrastructure; and

"(iii) implementing processes, plans, and policies for guiding the Administration's Centers on whether to maintain, repair, upgrade, or modernize a facility or infrastructure and for determining the type of instrument to be used;

"(F) an assessment of modifications needed to maximize usage of facilities that offer unique and highly specialized benefits to the aerospace industry and the American public; and

"(G) implementation steps, including a timeline, milestones, and an estimate of resources required for carrying out the plan.

"(d) Requirement To Establish Policy.—

"(1) In general.—Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act [Mar. 21, 2017], the Administrator shall establish and make publicly available a policy that guides the Administration's use of existing authorities to out-grant, lease, excess to the General Services Administration, sell, decommission, demolish, or otherwise transfer property, facilities, or infrastructure.

"(2) Criteria.—The policy shall include criteria for the use of authorities, best practices, standardized procedures, and guidelines for how to appropriately manage property, facilities, and infrastructure.

"(e) Submission to Congress.—Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress [Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives] the plan developed under subsection (c)."
