### §60501. Goal ###

The goal for the Administration's Earth Science program shall be to pursue a program of Earth observations, research, and applications activities to better understand the Earth, how it supports life, and how human activities affect its ability to do so in the future. In pursuit of this goal, the Administration's Earth Science program shall ensure that securing practical benefits for society will be an important measure of its success in addition to securing new knowledge about the Earth system and climate change. In further pursuit of this goal, the Administration shall, together with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other relevant agencies, provide United States leadership in developing and carrying out a cooperative international Earth observations-based research program.

#### Earth Science Missions and Programs ####

Pub. L. 117–167, div. B, title VII, §10824, Aug. 9, 2022, 136 Stat. 1742, provided that:

"(a) Sense of Congress.—It is the sense of Congress that—

"(1) the Earth science and applications program of the [National Aeronautics and Space] Administration provides increasingly valuable data for natural resource management, agriculture, forestry, food security, air quality monitoring, and many other application areas; and

"(2) a robust and balanced Earth science and applications program contributes significantly to—

"(A) the scientific discovery and economic growth of the United States; and

"(B) supporting the health and safety of the people of the United States and the citizens of the world.

"(b) Reaffirmation.—Congress reaffirms the goal for the Administration's Earth science and applications program set forth in section 60501 of title 51, United States Code, which states: 'The goal for the Administration's Earth Science program shall be to pursue a program of Earth observations, research, and applications activities to better understand the Earth, how it supports life, and how human activities affect its ability to do so in the future. In pursuit of this goal, the Administration's Earth Science program shall ensure that securing practical benefits for society will be an important measure of its success in addition to securing new knowledge about the Earth system and climate change. In further pursuit of this goal, the Administration shall, together with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other relevant agencies, provide United States leadership in developing and carrying out a cooperative international Earth observations-based research program.'.[sic]

"(c) Earth Science Missions and Programs.—With respect to the missions and programs of the Earth Science Division, the Administrator [of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration] shall, to the maximum extent practicable, follow the recommendations and guidance provided by the scientific community through the decadal survey for Earth science and applications from space of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, including—

"(1) the science priorities described in such survey;

"(2) the execution of the series of existing or previously planned observations (commonly known as the 'program of record'); and

"(3) the development of a range of missions of all classes, including opportunities for principal investigator-led, competitively selected missions.

"(d) Earth System Observatory.—The Administrator shall pursue an Earth System Observatory, which shall consist of an array of new and complementary Earth-observing scientific satellites, instruments, and missions—

"(1) to address the recommendations of the 2018 Earth science and applications decadal survey of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine entitled 'Thriving on our Changing Planet', including by conducting priority observations in—

"(A) aerosols;

"(B) cloud convection and precipitation;

"(C) mass change;

"(D) surface biology and geology;

"(E) surface deformation and change; and

"(F) other observation areas designated as high-priority by such decadal survey; and

"(2) to achieve the goal of the Earth Science Program set forth in section 60501 of title 51, United States Code.

"(e) Survey of Use of Earth Observation Data by States, Tribes, and Territories.—

"(1) Survey.—The Administrator shall arrange for the conduct of a survey of the use of NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] Earth observation data by States, Tribal organizations, and territories.

"(2) Submission.—Not later than 18 months after the date of the enactment of this Act [Aug. 9, 2022], the Administrator shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress [Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives] the results of the survey conducted under paragraph (1).

"(f) Climate Architecture Plan.—The Administrator shall—

"(1) maintain a comprehensive, strategic Climate Architecture Plan for Earth Observations and Applications from Space that describes an integrated and balanced program of Earth science and applications observations to advance science, policy, and applications and societal benefits; and

"(2) update such plan every 5 years so as to align with the release of the decadal surveys in Earth science and applications from space and the mid-decade assessments of the National Academics of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [probably should be "National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine"]."

#### Carbon Cycle Remote Sensing Applications Research ####

Pub. L. 106–391, title III, §315, Oct. 30, 2000, 114 Stat. 1595, provided that:

"(a) Carbon Cycle Remote Sensing Applications Research Program.—

"(1) In general.—The Administrator [of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration] shall develop a carbon cycle remote sensing applications research program—

"(A) to provide a comprehensive view of vegetation conditions;

"(B) to assess and model agricultural carbon sequestration; and

"(C) to encourage the development of commercial products, as appropriate.

"(2) Use of centers.—The Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration shall use regional earth science application centers to conduct applications research under this section.

"(3) Researched areas.—The areas that shall be the subjects of research conducted under this section include—

"(A) the mapping of carbon-sequestering land use and land cover;

"(B) the monitoring of changes in land cover and management;

"(C) new approaches for the remote sensing of soil carbon; and

"(D) region-scale carbon sequestration estimation.

"(b) Authorization of Appropriations.—There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section $5,000,000 of funds authorized by section 102 [114 Stat. 1581] for fiscal years 2001 through 2002."

#### Earth Observing System ####

Pub. L. 102–588, title I, §102(g), Nov. 4, 1992, 106 Stat. 5111, directed the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to carry out an Earth Observing System program addressing highest priority international climate change research goals; within 180 days after Nov. 4, 1992, submit to Congress a plan to ensure that the highest priority measurements were maintained on schedule to the greatest extent practicable while lower priority measurements were deferred or deleted; and within 90 days after Nov. 4, 1992, submit to Congress a Development Plan.
