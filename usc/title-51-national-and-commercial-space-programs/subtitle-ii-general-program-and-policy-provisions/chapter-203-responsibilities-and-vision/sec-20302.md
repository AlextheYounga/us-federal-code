#### "SEC. 431. FINDINGS ON HUMAN SPACE EXPLORATION. ####

"Congress makes the following findings:

"(1) In accordance with section 204 of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (124 Stat. 2813), the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, through its Committee on Human Spaceflight, conducted a review of the goals, core capabilities, and direction of human space flight, and published the findings and recommendations in a 2014 report entitled, 'Pathways to Exploration: Rationales and Approaches for a U.S. Program of Human Space Exploration'.

"(2) The Committee on Human Spaceflight included leaders from the aerospace, scientific, security, and policy communities.

"(3) With input from the public, the Committee on Human Spaceflight concluded that many practical and aspirational rationales for human space flight together constitute a compelling case for continued national investment and pursuit of human space exploration toward the horizon goal of Mars.

"(4) According to the Committee on Human Spaceflight, the rationales include economic benefits, national security, national prestige, inspiring students and other citizens, scientific discovery, human survival, and a sense of shared destiny.

"(5) The Committee on Human Spaceflight affirmed that Mars is the appropriate long-term goal for the human space flight program.

"(6) The Committee on Human Spaceflight recommended that NASA define a series of sustainable steps and conduct mission planning and technology development as needed to achieve the long-term goal of placing humans on the surface of Mars.

"(7) Expanding human presence beyond low-Earth orbit and advancing toward human missions to Mars requires early planning and timely decisions to be made in the near-term on the necessary courses of action for commitments to achieve short-term and long-term goals and objectives.

"(8) In addition to the 2014 report described in paragraph (1), there are several independently developed reports or concepts that describe potential Mars architectures or concepts and identify Mars as the long-term goal for human space exploration, including NASA's 'The Global Exploration Roadmap' of 2013, 'NASA's Journey to Mars–Pioneering Next Steps in Space Exploration' of 2015, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory's 'Minimal Architecture for Human Journeys to Mars' of 2015, and Explore Mars' 'The Humans to Mars Report 2016'.

#### "SEC. 432. HUMAN EXPLORATION ROADMAP. ####

"(a) Sense of Congress.—It is the sense of Congress that—

"(1) expanding human presence beyond low-Earth orbit and advancing toward human missions to Mars in the 2030s requires early strategic planning and timely decisions to be made in the near-term on the necessary courses of action for commitments to achieve short-term and long-term goals and objectives;

"(2) for strong and sustained United States leadership, a need exists to advance a human exploration roadmap, addressing exploration objectives in collaboration with international, academic, and industry partners;

"(3) an approach that incrementally advances toward a long-term goal is one in which nearer-term developments and implementation would influence future development and implementation; and

"(4) a human exploration roadmap should begin with low-Earth orbit, then address in greater detail progress beyond low-Earth orbit to cis-lunar space, and then address future missions aimed at human arrival and activities near and then on the surface of Mars.

"(b) Human Exploration Roadmap.—

"(1) In general.—The Administrator shall develop a human exploration roadmap, including a critical decision plan, to expand human presence beyond low-Earth orbit to the surface of Mars and beyond, considering potential interim destinations such as cis-lunar space and the moons of Mars.

"(A) an integrated set of exploration, science, and other goals and objectives of a United States human space exploration program to achieve the long-term goal of human missions near or on the surface of Mars in the 2030s;

"(B) opportunities for international, academic, and industry partnerships for exploration-related systems, services, research, and technology if those opportunities provide cost-savings, accelerate program schedules, or otherwise benefit the goals and objectives developed under subparagraph (A);

"(C) sets and sequences of precursor missions in cis-lunar space and other missions or activities necessary—

"(i) to demonstrate the proficiency of the capabilities and technologies identified under subparagraph (D); and
