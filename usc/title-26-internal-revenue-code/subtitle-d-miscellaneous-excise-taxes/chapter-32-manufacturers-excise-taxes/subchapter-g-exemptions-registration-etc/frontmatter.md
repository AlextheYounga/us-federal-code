#### Amendments ####

**1986**—Pub. L. 99–514, title XVIII, §1899A(74), Oct. 22, 1986, 100 Stat. 2963, substituted “reference” for “references” in item 4227.

**1983**—Pub. L. 97–473, title II, §202(b)(9), Jan. 14, 1983, 96 Stat. 2610, purported to substitute “Cross references” for “Cross reference” in item 4227. No change in text was required because item 4227 as originally enacted by section 119(a) of Pub. L. 85–859 already read “Cross references”.
