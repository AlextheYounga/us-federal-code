The response protocol described in this paragraph is, in the case of an individual enrolled under a group health plan who requests information through a telephone call or electronic, web-based, or Internet-based means on whether a health care provider or health care facility has a contractual relationship to furnish items and services under such plan, a protocol under which such plan or such issuer (as applicable), in the case such request is made through a telephone call—

#### (1) In general ####

For plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2022, in the case of an item or service furnished to a participant or beneficiary of a group health plan by a nonparticipating provider or a nonparticipating facility, if such item or service would otherwise be covered under such plan if furnished by a participating provider or participating facility and if either of the criteria described in paragraph (2) applies with respect to such participant or beneficiary and item or service, the plan—

(A) shall not impose on such participant or beneficiary a cost-sharing amount for such item or service so furnished that is greater than the cost-sharing amount that would apply under such plan had such item or service been furnished by a participating provider; and

(B) shall apply the deductible or out-of-pocket maximum, if any, that would apply if such services were furnished by a participating provider or a participating facility.

#### (2) Criteria described ####

For purposes of paragraph (1), the criteria described in this paragraph, with respect to an item or service furnished to a participant or beneficiary of a group health plan by a nonparticipating provider or a nonparticipating facility, are the following:

(A) The participant or beneficiary received through a database, provider directory, or response protocol described in subsection (a) information with respect to such item and service to be furnished and such information provided that the provider was a participating provider or facility was a participating facility, with respect to the plan for furnishing such item or service.

(B) The information was not provided, in accordance with subsection (a), to the participant or beneficiary and the participant or beneficiary requested through the response protocol described in subsection (a)(3) of the plan information on whether the provider was a participating provider or facility was a participating facility with respect to the plan for furnishing such item or service and was informed through such protocol that the provider was such a participating provider or facility was such a participating facility.

#### (c) Disclosure on patient protections against balance billing ####

For plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2022, each group health plan shall make publicly available, post on a public website of such plan or issuer, and include on each explanation of benefits for an item or service with respect to which the requirements under section 9816 applies—
