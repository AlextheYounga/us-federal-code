#### (2) Excess deduction award ####

If the cost to the employer of the employee achievement award received by the taxpayer exceeds the amount allowable as a deduction to the employer, then gross income includes the greater of—

The remaining portion of the value of such award shall not be included in the gross income of the recipient.

#### (3) Treatment of tax-exempt employers ####

In the case of an employer exempt from taxation under this subtitle, any reference in this subsection to the amount allowable as a deduction to the employer shall be treated as a reference to the amount which would be allowable as a deduction to the employer if the employer were not exempt from taxation under this subtitle.
