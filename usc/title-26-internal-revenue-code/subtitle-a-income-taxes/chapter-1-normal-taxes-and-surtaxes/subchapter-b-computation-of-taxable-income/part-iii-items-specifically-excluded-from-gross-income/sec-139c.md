#### (b) Qualified first responder retirement payments ####

For purposes of this section, the term "qualified first responder retirement payments" means, with respect to any taxable year, any pension or annuity which but for this section would be includible in gross income for such taxable year and which is received—

(2) in connection with such individual's qualified first responder service.

#### (c) Annualized excludable disability amount ####

For purposes of this section—

In the case of an individual who only receives service-connected excludable disability amounts properly attributable to a portion of the 12-month period described in paragraph (1), such paragraph shall be applied by multiplying such amounts by the ratio of 365 to the number of days in such period to which such amounts were properly attributable.
