#### (b) Amount of deduction ####

The amount of the deduction under subsection (a) shall be equal to—

#### (c) Limitation and carryover ####

#### (1) In general ####

Subject to paragraph (2), the deduction allowed under subsection (a) for any taxable year shall not exceed the taxable income (as determined without regard to such deduction) of the Native Corporation for the taxable year in which the contribution was made.

#### (2) Carryover ####

If the aggregate amount of contributions described in subsection (a) for any taxable year exceeds the limitation under paragraph (1), such excess shall be treated as a contribution described in subsection (a) in each of the 15 succeeding years in order of time.

#### (2) Treatment ####

In the case of property described in paragraph (1), any income or gain realized on the sale or exchange of such property shall be treated as—

(A) for such amount of the income or gain as is equal to or less than the amount of income which would be included in income at the time of contribution under subsection (f)(3) but for the taxpayer's election under this subsection, ordinary income, and

(B) for any amounts of the income or gain which are in excess of the amount of income which would be included in income at the time of contribution under subsection (f)(3) but for the taxpayer's election under this subsection, having the same character as if this subsection did not apply.

#### (3) Election ####

#### (A) In general ####

For each taxable year, a Settlement Trust may elect to apply this subsection for any property described in paragraph (1) which was contributed during such year.

#### (i) In general ####

In the case of any property for which an election is in effect under this subsection and which is disposed of within the first taxable year subsequent to the taxable year in which such property was contributed to the Settlement Trust—

(I) this section shall be applied as if the election under this subsection had not been made,

(II) any income or gain which would have been included in the year of contribution under subsection (f)(3) but for the taxpayer's election under this subsection shall be included in income for the taxable year of such contribution, and
