As a condition of, and prior to, any amount being treated as a payment which is made by the taxpayer under paragraph (1) or any payment being made pursuant to subparagraph (A), the Secretary may require such information or registration as the Secretary deems necessary or appropriate for purposes of preventing duplication, fraud, improper payments, or excessive payments under this section.
