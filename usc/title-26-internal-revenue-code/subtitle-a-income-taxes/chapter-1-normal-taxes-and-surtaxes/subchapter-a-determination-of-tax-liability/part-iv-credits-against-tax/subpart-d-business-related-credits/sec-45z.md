### §45Z. Clean fuel production credit ###

#### (a) Amount of credit ####

#### (1) In general ####

For purposes of section 38, the clean fuel production credit for any taxable year is an amount equal to the product of—

(A) the applicable amount per gallon (or gallon equivalent) with respect to any transportation fuel which is—

(i) produced by the taxpayer at a qualified facility, and

(ii) sold by the taxpayer in a manner described in paragraph (4) during the taxable year, and

(B) the emissions factor for such fuel (as determined under subsection (b)).

#### (2) Applicable amount ####

#### (A) Base amount ####

In the case of any transportation fuel produced at a qualified facility which does not satisfy the requirements described in subparagraph (B), the applicable amount shall be 20 cents.

#### (B) Alternative amount ####

In the case of any transportation fuel produced at a qualified facility which satisfies the requirements under paragraphs (6) and (7) of subsection (f), the applicable amount shall be $1.00.

#### (3) Special rate for sustainable aviation fuel ####

#### (A) In general ####

In the case of a transportation fuel which is sustainable aviation fuel, paragraph (2) shall be applied—

(i) in the case of fuel produced at a qualified facility described in paragraph (2)(A), by substituting "35 cents" for "20 cents", and

(ii) in the case of fuel produced at a qualified facility described in paragraph (2)(B), by substituting "$1.75" for "$1.00".

#### (B) Sustainable aviation fuel ####

For purposes of this subparagraph (A),<sup><a href="#45Z_1_target" name="45Z_1">1</a></sup> the term "sustainable aviation fuel" means liquid fuel, the portion of which is not kerosene, which is sold for use in an aircraft and which—

(i) meets the requirements of—

(I) ASTM International Standard D7566, or

(II) the Fischer Tropsch provisions of ASTM International Standard D1655, Annex A1, and

(ii) is not derived from palm fatty acid distillates or petroleum.

#### (4) Sale ####

For purposes of paragraph (1), the transportation fuel is sold in a manner described in this paragraph if such fuel is sold by the taxpayer to an unrelated person—

(A) for use by such person in the production of a fuel mixture,

(B) for use by such person in a trade or business, or

(C) who sells such fuel at retail to another person and places such fuel in the fuel tank of such other person.

#### (5) Rounding ####

If any amount determined under paragraph (1) is not a multiple of 1 cent, such amount shall be rounded to the nearest cent.

#### (b) Emissions factors ####

#### (1) Emissions factor ####

#### (A) Calculation ####

#### (i) In general ####

The emissions factor of a transportation fuel shall be an amount equal to the quotient of—

(I) an amount equal to—

(aa) 50 kilograms of CO<sub>2</sub>e per mmBTU, minus

(bb) the emissions rate for such fuel, divided by

(II) 50 kilograms of CO<sub>2</sub>e per mmBTU.

#### (B) Establishment of emissions rate ####

#### (i) In general ####

Subject to clauses (ii) and (iii), the Secretary shall annually publish a table which sets forth the emissions rate for similar types and categories of transportation fuels based on the amount of lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions (as described in section 211(o)(1)(H) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(1)(H)), as in effect on the date of the enactment of this section) for such fuels, expressed as kilograms of CO<sub>2</sub>e per mmBTU, which a taxpayer shall use for purposes of this section.

#### (ii) Non-aviation fuel ####

In the case of any transportation fuel which is not a sustainable aviation fuel, the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of such fuel shall be based on the most recent determinations under the Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation model developed by Argonne National Laboratory, or a successor model (as determined by the Secretary).

#### (iii) Aviation fuel ####

In the case of any transportation fuel which is a sustainable aviation fuel, the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of such fuel shall be determined in accordance with—

(I) the most recent Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation which has been adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization with the agreement of the United States, or

(II) any similar methodology which satisfies the criteria under section 211(o)(1)(H) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(1)(H)), as in effect on the date of enactment of this section.

#### (C) Rounding of emissions rate ####

#### (i) In general ####

Subject to clause (ii), the Secretary may round the emissions rates under subparagraph (B) to the nearest multiple of 5 kilograms of CO<sub>2</sub>e per mmBTU.

#### (ii) Exception ####

In the case of an emissions rate that is between 2.5 kilograms of CO<sub>2</sub>e per mmBTU and -2.5 kilograms of CO<sub>2</sub>e per mmBTU, the Secretary may round such rate to zero.

#### (D) Provisional emissions rate ####

In the case of any transportation fuel for which an emissions rate has not been established under subparagraph (B), a taxpayer producing such fuel may file a petition with the Secretary for determination of the emissions rate with respect to such fuel.

#### (2) Rounding ####

If any amount determined under paragraph (1)(A) is not a multiple of 0.1, such amount shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of 0.1.

#### (c) Inflation adjustment ####

#### (1) In general ####

In the case of calendar years beginning after 2024, the 20 cent amount in subsection (a)(2)(A), the $1.00 amount in subsection (a)(2)(B), the 35 cent amount in subsection (a)(3)(A)(i), and the $1.75 amount in subsection (a)(3)(A)(ii) shall each be adjusted by multiplying such amount by the inflation adjustment factor for the calendar year in which the sale of the transportation fuel occurs. If any amount as increased under the preceding sentence is not a multiple of 1 cent, such amount shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of 1 cent.

#### (2) Inflation adjustment factor ####

For purposes of paragraph (1), the inflation adjustment factor shall be the inflation adjustment factor determined and published by the Secretary pursuant to section 45Y(c), determined by substituting "calendar year 2022" for "calendar year 1992" in paragraph (3) thereof.
