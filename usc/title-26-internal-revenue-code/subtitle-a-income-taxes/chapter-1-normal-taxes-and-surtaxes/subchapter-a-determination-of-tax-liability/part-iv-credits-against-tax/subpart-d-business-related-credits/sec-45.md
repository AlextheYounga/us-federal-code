### §45. Electricity produced from certain renewable resources, etc. ###

#### (a) General rule ####

For purposes of section 38, the renewable electricity production credit for any taxable year is an amount equal to the product of—

#### (b) Limitations and adjustments ####

#### (1) Phaseout of credit ####

The amount of the credit determined under subsection (a) shall be reduced by an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of the credit (determined without regard to this paragraph) as—

(A) the amount by which the reference price for the calendar year in which the sale occurs exceeds 8 cents, bears to

(B) 3 cents.
