#### (B) Treatment of certain receipts ####

#### (i) In general ####

Subject to clause (iii), the amount determined under subparagraph (A)(ii)(I) shall include any amount received by the taxpayer during the taxable year with respect to the qualified nuclear power facility from a zero-emission credit program.

For purposes of this subparagraph, the term "zero-emission credit program" means any payments with respect to a qualified nuclear power facility as a result of any Federal, State or local government program for, in whole or in part, the zero-emission, zero-carbon, or air quality attributes of any portion of the electricity produced by such facility.

#### (iii) Exclusion ####

For purposes of clause (i), any amount received by the taxpayer from a zero-emission credit program shall be excluded from the amount determined under subparagraph (A)(ii)(I) if the full amount of the credit calculated pursuant to subsection (a) (determined without regard to this subparagraph) is used to reduce payments from such zero-emission credit program.

#### (3) Electricity ####

For purposes of this section, the term "electricity" means the energy produced by a qualified nuclear power facility from the conversion of nuclear fuel into electric power.

#### (c) Other rules ####

#### (1) Inflation adjustment ####

The 0.3 cent amount in subsection (a)(1)(A) and the 2.5 cent amount in subsection (b)(2)(A)(ii)(II)(aa) shall each be adjusted by multiplying such amount by the inflation adjustment factor (as determined under section 45(e)(2), as applied by substituting "calendar year 2023" for "calendar year 1992" in subparagraph (B) thereof) for the calendar year in which the sale occurs. If the 0.3 cent amount as increased under this paragraph is not a multiple of 0.05 cent, such amount shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of 0.05 cent. If the 2.5 cent amount as increased under this paragraph is not a multiple of 0.1 cent, such amount shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of 0.1 cent.

#### (2) Prevailing wage requirements ####
