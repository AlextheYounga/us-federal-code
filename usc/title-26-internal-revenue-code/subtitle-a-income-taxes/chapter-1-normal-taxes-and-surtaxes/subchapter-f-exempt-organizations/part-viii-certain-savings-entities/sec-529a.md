A qualified ABLE program shall be exempt from taxation under this subtitle. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, such program shall be subject to the taxes imposed by section 511 (relating to imposition of tax on unrelated business income of charitable organizations).

#### (b) Qualified ABLE program ####

For purposes of this section—

#### (1) In general ####

The term "qualified ABLE program" means a program established and maintained by a State, or agency or instrumentality thereof—

(A) under which a person may make contributions for a taxable year, for the benefit of an individual who is an eligible individual for such taxable year, to an ABLE account which is established for the purpose of meeting the qualified disability expenses of the designated beneficiary of the account,

(B) which limits a designated beneficiary to 1 ABLE account for purposes of this section, and

(C) which meets the other requirements of this section.

#### (2) Cash contributions ####

A program shall not be treated as a qualified ABLE program unless it provides that no contribution will be accepted—

(A) unless it is in cash, or

(B) except in the case of contributions under subsection (c)(1)(C), if such contribution to an ABLE account would result in aggregate contributions from all contributors to the ABLE account for the taxable year exceeding the amount in effect under section 2503(b) for the calendar year in which the taxable year begins.

For purposes of this paragraph, rules similar to the rules of section 408(d)(4) (determined without regard to subparagraph (B) thereof) shall apply.

#### (3) Separate accounting ####

A program shall not be treated as a qualified ABLE program unless it provides separate accounting for each designated beneficiary.

A program shall not be treated as a qualified ABLE program if it allows any interest in the program or any portion thereof to be used as security for a loan.

#### (6) Prohibition on excess contributions ####

A program shall not be treated as a qualified ABLE program unless it provides adequate safeguards to prevent aggregate contributions on behalf of a designated beneficiary in excess of the limit established by the State under section 529(b)(6).

For purposes of this paragraph, if distributions from a qualified ABLE program—

(i) do not exceed the qualified disability expenses of the designated beneficiary, no amount shall be includible in gross income, and

(ii) in any other case, the amount otherwise includible in gross income shall be reduced by an amount which bears the same ratio to such amount as such expenses bear to such distributions.

#### (C) Change in designated beneficiaries or programs ####

#### (i) Rollovers from able accounts ####

Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any amount paid or distributed from an ABLE account to the extent that the amount received is paid, not later than the 60th day after the date of such payment or distribution, into another ABLE account for the benefit of the same designated beneficiary or an eligible individual who is a member of the family of the designated beneficiary.

#### (ii) Change in designated beneficiaries ####

Any change in the designated beneficiary of an interest in a qualified ABLE program during a taxable year shall not be treated as a distribution for purposes of subparagraph (A) if the new beneficiary is an eligible individual for such taxable year and a member of the family of the former beneficiary.

Clause (i) shall not apply to any transfer if such transfer occurs within 12 months from the date of a previous transfer to any qualified ABLE program for the benefit of the designated beneficiary.

#### (2) Gift tax rules ####

For purposes of chapters 12 and 13—

#### (A) Contributions ####

Any contribution to a qualified ABLE program on behalf of any designated beneficiary—

(i) shall be treated as a completed gift to such designated beneficiary which is not a future interest in property, and

(ii) shall not be treated as a qualified transfer under section 2503(e).

#### (B) Treatment of distributions ####

In no event shall a distribution from an ABLE account to such account's designated beneficiary be treated as a taxable gift.

#### (C) Treatment of transfer to new designated beneficiary ####

Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to the distribution of any contribution made during a taxable year on behalf of the designated beneficiary if—

(i) such distribution is received on or before the day prescribed by law (including extensions of time) for filing such designated beneficiary's return for such taxable year, and

(ii) such distribution is accompanied by the amount of net income attributable to such excess contribution.

Any net income described in clause (ii) shall be included in gross income for the taxable year in which such excess contribution was made.
