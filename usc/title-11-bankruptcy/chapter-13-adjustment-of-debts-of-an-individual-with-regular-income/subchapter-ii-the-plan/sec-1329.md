(B)(i) if the debtor previously paid for health insurance, the amount is not materially larger than the cost the debtor previously paid or the cost necessary to maintain the lapsed policy; or

(c) A plan modified under this section may not provide for payments over a period that expires after the applicable commitment period under section 1325(b)(1)(B) after the time that the first payment under the original confirmed plan was due, unless the court, for cause, approves a longer period, but the court may not approve a period that expires after five years after such time.

(d)(1) Subject to paragraph (3), for a plan confirmed prior to the date of enactment of the COVID–19 Bankruptcy Relief Extension Act of 2021, the plan may be modified upon the request of the debtor if—

(e)(1) A debtor of a case for which a creditor files a proof of claim under section 501(f) may file a request for a modification of the plan to provide for the proof of claim.
