#### Reporting and Investigating Allegations of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Within the Central Intelligence Agency ####

Pub. L. 118–31, div. G, title III, §7339(a), Dec. 22, 2023, 137 Stat. 1051, provided that:

"(a) Sense of Congress.—It is the sense of Congress that—

"(1) sexual assault and sexual harassment arise from, and are often indicative of, an environment where toxic, provocative, and sometimes significantly inappropriate behavior is tolerated;

"(2) when supervisors and senior leaders at headquarters and in the field are among the offenders and facilitate a work climate in which toxic and disrespectful behavior is tolerated, harassment and even assault will often go unaddressed and unpunished;

"(3) while establishing clear policies and procedures and enhancing training are necessary first steps toward protecting victims and establishing stronger internal mechanisms for preventing and responding to future sexual assault and sexual harassment within the Central Intelligence Agency, comprehensive culture change driven by Agency leadership will be necessary to accomplish impactful and enduring improvement; and

"(4) it is vital for the Central Intelligence Agency to maintain an independent and neutral person with whom all employees at all levels, supervisors and non-supervisors, may speak confidentially, informally, and off-the-record about work-related concerns or questions."
