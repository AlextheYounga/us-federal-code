#### (a) Policies relating to restricted and unrestricted reporting of sexual assault and sexual harassment ####

#### (1) In general ####

The Director shall develop and implement policies, regulations, personnel training, and workforce education to establish and provide information about restricted reports and unrestricted reports of allegations of sexual assault and sexual harassment within the Agency in accordance with this subsection.

#### (2) Workforce education ####

Workforce education developed under paragraph (1) shall be designed to clearly inform Agency employees of the differences between restricted and unrestricted reporting of allegations of sexual assault and sexual harassment, and which individual or office within the Agency is responsible for receiving each type of report.

#### (3) Relationship to the Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention Office ####

To the extent consistent with preserving a victim's complete autonomy, the policies, regulations, training, and messaging described in this subsection shall—

(A) encourage Agency employees to make restricted or unrestricted reports of sexual assault and sexual harassment to the Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention Office;

(B) encourage Agency employees to use the Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention Office as the primary point of contact and entry point for Agency employees to make restricted or unrestricted reports of sexual assault and sexual harassment;

(C) encourage Agency employees to seek the victim advocacy services of the Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention Office after reporting an allegation of sexual assault or sexual harassment, to the extent consistent with the victim's election; and

(D) encourage Agency employees and individuals who receive disclosures of sexual assault and sexual harassment to provide the report to, and receive guidance from, the Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention Office.

#### (b) Election ####

Any person making a report containing an allegation of a sexual assault or sexual harassment shall elect whether to make a restricted report or an unrestricted report. Once an election is made to make an unrestricted report, such election may not be changed.

#### (c) Unrestricted reports ####

#### (1) Assistance ####

A person who elects to make an unrestricted report containing an allegation of sexual assault or sexual harassment may seek the assistance of another employee of the Agency with taking the action required under paragraph (2).

#### (2) Action required ####

A person electing to make an unrestricted report containing an allegation of sexual assault or sexual harassment shall submit the report to the Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention Office. To the extent consistent with the person's election after consultation with the Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention Office, the Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention Office may facilitate the person's contact with any other appropriate Agency official or office, and make available to Agency employees the following:

(A) A list of physicians and mental health care providers (including from the private sector, as applicable) who have experience with the physical and mental health care needs of the Agency workforce.

(B) A list of chaplains and religious counselors who have experience with the needs of the Agency workforce, including information regarding access to the Chaplain Corps established under section 3527 of this title.

(C) Information regarding how to select and retain private attorneys who have experience with the legal needs of the Agency workforce, including detailed information on the process for the appropriate sharing of information with retained private attorneys.

#### (3) Rule of construction ####

The inclusion of any person on a list maintained or made available pursuant to subsection (c)(2) shall not be construed as an endorsement of such person (or any service furnished by such person), and neither the Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention Office nor the Agency shall be liable, as a result of such inclusion, for any portion of compensable injury, loss, or damage attributable to such person or service.

#### (d) Restricted reports ####

#### (1) Process for making reports ####

A person who elects to make a restricted report containing an allegation of sexual assault or sexual harassment shall submit the report to the Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention Office.

#### (2) Action required ####

A restricted report containing an allegation of sexual assault or sexual harassment—

(A) shall be treated by the person who receives the report in the same manner as a communication covered by the privilege set forth in this section;

(B) shall not result in a referral to law enforcement or commencement of a formal administrative investigation, unless the victim elects to change the report from a restricted report to an unrestricted report;

(C) in a case requiring an employee reassignment, relocation, or other mitigation or protective measures, shall result only in actions that are managed in a manner to limit, to the extent possible, the disclosure of any information contained in the report;

(D) shall be exempt from any Federal or, to the maximum extent permitted by the Constitution, State reporting requirements, including the requirements under section 535(b) of title 28, section 3517(b)(5) of this title, relevant provisions of Executive Order 12333 (50 U.S.C. 3001 note; relating to United States intelligence activities), or successor order, Executive Order 13462 (50 U.S.C. 3001 note; relating to President's intelligence advisory board and intelligence oversight board), or successor order, title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.), the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. 621 et seq.), title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12111 et seq.), and sections 791 and 794a of title 29, except when reporting is necessary to prevent or mitigate an imminent threat of serious bodily harm.

#### (3) Rule of construction ####

The receipt of a restricted report submitted under subsection (d) shall not be construed as imputing actual or constructive knowledge of an alleged incident of sexual assault or sexual harassment to the Agency for the purpose of the Agency's responsibility to exercise reasonable care to take immediate and appropriate corrective action to prevent and correct harassing behavior.

#### (e) Privileged communications with Agency employees ####

#### (1) In general ####

A victim shall be entitled to maintain and assert a privilege against disclosure of, and be able to prevent any other person from disclosing, any confidential communication made between the victim and any employee of the Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention Office, if such communication was made for the purpose of facilitating advice or assistance to the victim in accordance with this section. A victim may consent to additional disclosures.

#### (2) When a communication is confidential ####

A communication is confidential for the purposes of this section if made in the course of the relationship between the victim and any employee of the Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention Office and not intended to be disclosed to third persons, other than those to whom disclosure is made in furtherance of the provision of advice or assistance to the victim or those reasonably necessary for such transmission of the communication.

#### (3) Maintenance of privilege ####

The privilege is maintained by the victim. A victim may authorize the Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention Office employee who received the communication to assert the privilege on his or her behalf, with confidentiality. The Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention Office employee who received the communication may assert the privilege on behalf of the victim. The authority of such Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention Office employee to so assert the privilege is presumed in the absence of evidence to the contrary.

#### (4) Exceptions ####

The privilege shall not apply to prevent limited disclosures necessary under the following circumstances:

(A) When the victim is deceased.

(B) When the Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention Office employee who received the communication has a reasonable belief that a victim's mental or emotional condition makes the victim a danger to any person, including the victim.

(C) When the otherwise privileged communication clearly contemplates the future commission of a crime or breach of national security, or aiding any individual to commit or plan to commit what the victim knew or reasonable should have known to be a crime or breach of national security.

(D) When disclosure of a communication is constitutionally required.

#### (5) Handling of exceptions ####

When the Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention Office employee determines that information requires an exception to the privilege, the Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention Office employee who received the communication will protect information pertaining to the facts and circumstances surrounding the underlying sexual assault or sexual harassment allegations to the greatest extent possible.
