#### (b) Certification required with respect to automatic declassification of records ####

Not later than February 1, 2001, the Secretary of Energy shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate a report on the efforts of the Department of Energy relating to the declassification of classified records under the control of the Department of Energy. Such report shall include the following:

(1) An assessment of whether the Department will be able to review all relevant records for declassification before any date established for automatic declassification.

(2) An estimate of the number of records, if any, that the Department will be unable to review for declassification before any such date and the effect on national security of the automatic declassification of those records.
