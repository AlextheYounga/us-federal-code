### §2754. Life-cycle cost estimates of certain atomic energy defense capital assets ###

#### (a) In general ####

The Secretary of Energy shall ensure that an independent life-cycle cost estimate under Department of Energy Order 413.3B (relating to program management and project management for the acquisition of capital assets), or a successor order, of each capital asset described in subsection (b) is conducted before the asset achieves critical decision 2 in the acquisition process.

#### (b) Capital assets described ####

A capital asset described in this subsection is an atomic energy defense capital asset—

(1) the total project cost of which exceeds $100,000,000; and

(2) the purpose of which is to perform a limited-life, single-purpose mission.

#### (c) Independent defined ####

For purposes of subsection (a), the term "independent", with respect to a life-cycle cost estimate of a capital asset, means that the life-cycle cost estimate is prepared by an organization independent of the project sponsor, using the same detailed technical and procurement information as the sponsor, to determine if the life-cycle cost estimate of the sponsor is accurate and reasonable.
