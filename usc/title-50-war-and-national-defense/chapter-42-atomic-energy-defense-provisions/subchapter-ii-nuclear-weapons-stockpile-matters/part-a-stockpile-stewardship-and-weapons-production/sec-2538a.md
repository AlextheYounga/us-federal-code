(D) an explanation of any changes to the production goals or requirements as compared to the report submitted during the previous year.

In this subsection, the term "covered project" means—

(1) the Savannah River Plutonium Processing Facility, Savannah River Site, Aiken, South Carolina (Project 21–D–511); or

(2) the Plutonium Pit Production Project, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico (Project 21–D–512).

#### Sense of Congress Related to Modification to Certain Requirements Relating to Plutonium Pit Production Capacity ####

Pub. L. 116–92, div. C, title XXXI, §3116(a), Dec. 20, 2019, 133 Stat. 1951, provided that: "It is the sense of Congress that—

"(1) rebuilding a robust plutonium pit production infrastructure with a capacity of up to 80 pits per year is critical to maintaining the viability of the nuclear weapons stockpile;

"(2) that effort will require cooperation from experts across the nuclear security enterprise; and

"(3) any further delay to achieving a plutonium sustainment capability to support the planned stockpile life extension programs will result in an unacceptable capability gap to our deterrent posture."
