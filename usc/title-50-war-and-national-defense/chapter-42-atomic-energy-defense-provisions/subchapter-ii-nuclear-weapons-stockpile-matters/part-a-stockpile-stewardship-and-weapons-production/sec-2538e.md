(A) A description of the potential military characteristics of the weapon.

(B) A description of the stockpile-to-target sequence requirements of the weapon.

(C) An initial assessment of the requirements a W93 nuclear weapon program is likely to generate for the nuclear security enterprise, including—

(i) adjustments to the size and composition of the workforce;

(ii) additions to existing weapon design and production capabilities; or

(iii) additional facility recapitalization or new construction.

(D) A preliminary description of other significant requirements for a W93 nuclear weapon program, including—

(i) first production unit date;

(ii) initial operational capability date;

(iii) full operational capability date; and

(iv) any unique safety and surety requirements that could increase design complexity or cost estimate uncertainty.

#### (2) Phase 2 ####

#### (A) In general ####

Not later than 15 days after the date on which the Nuclear Weapons Council approves phase 2 of the joint nuclear weapons life cycle for the W93 nuclear weapon, the Administrator shall submit to the congressional defense committees a plan to implement a process of independent peer review or review by a board of experts, or both, with respect to—

(i) the nonnuclear components of the weapon;

(B) the proposed design for the weapon can be carried out within estimated schedule and cost objectives; and

(2) the Commander of the United States Strategic Command shall submit to the congressional defense committees a report containing the requirements for weapon quantity and composition by type for the sub-surface ballistic nuclear (SSBN) force, including such requirements planned for the 15-year period following the date of the report, including any planned life extensions, retirements, or alterations.
