"(5) Definitions.—In this subsection [pars. (1) to (4) not classified to the Code]:

"(A) Gray zone activity.—The term 'gray zone activity' means an activity to advance the national interests of a State that—

"(i) falls between ordinary statecraft and open warfare;

"(ii) is carried out with an intent to maximize the advancement of interests of the state without provoking a kinetic military response by the United States; and

"(iii) falls on a spectrum that ranges from covert adversary operations, to detectible covert adversary operations, to unattributable adversary operations, to deniable adversary operations, to open adversary operations.

"(B) Covert adversary operation.—The term 'covert adversary operation' means an operation by an adversary that—

"(i) the adversary intends to remain below the threshold at which the United States detects the operation; and

"(ii) does stay below such threshold.

"(C) Detectible covert adversary operation.—The term 'detectible covert adversary operation' means an operation by an adversary that—

"(i) the adversary intends to remain below the threshold at which the United States detects the operation; but

"(ii) is ultimately detected by the United States at a level below the level at which the United States will publicly attribute the operation to the adversary.

"(D) Unattributable adversary operation.—The term 'unattributable adversary operation' means an operation by an adversary that the adversary intends to be detected by the United States, but remains below the threshold at which the United States will publicly attribute the operation to the adversary.

"(E) Deniable adversary operation.—The term 'deniable adversary operation' means an operation by an adversary that—

"(i) the adversary intends to be detected and publicly or privately attributed by the United States; and

"(ii) the adversary intends to deny, to limit the response by the United States, and any allies of the United States.

"(F) Open adversary operation.—The term 'open adversary operation' means an operation by an adversary that the adversary openly acknowledges as attributable to the adversary.

"(c) Requirement to Develop Lexicon.—

"(1) Requirement.—The Director of National Intelligence, acting through the National Intelligence Council, shall develop a lexicon of common terms (and corresponding definitions for such terms) for concepts associated with gray zone activities.

"(2) Considerations.—In developing the lexicon under paragraph (1), the National Intelligence Council shall include in the lexicon each term (and the corresponding definition for each term) specified in subsection (b)(5), unless the National Intelligence Council determines that an alternative term (or alternative definition)—

"(A) more accurately describes a concept associated with gray zone activities; or

"(B) is preferable for any other reason.

"(3) Report.—

"(A) Publication.—The Director of National Intelligence shall publish a report containing the lexicon developed under paragraph (1).

"(B) Form.—The report under subparagraph (A) shall be published in unclassified form."
