#### Findings Regarding Improvement of Equality of Employment Opportunities in the Intelligence Community ####

Pub. L. 108–177, title III, §319, Dec. 13, 2003, 117 Stat. 2614, as amended by Pub. L. 108–458, title I, §1071(g)(3)(A)(iv), (B), Dec. 17, 2004, 118 Stat. 3692; Pub. L. 111–259, title III, §313(b)(1)(A), (3), Oct. 7, 2010, 124 Stat. 2666, provided that: "Congress makes the following findings:

"(1) It is the recommendation of the Joint Inquiry of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence into Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001, that the Intelligence Community should enhance recruitment of a more ethnically and culturally diverse workforce and devise a strategy to capitalize upon the unique cultural and linguistic capabilities of first generation Americans.

"(2) The Intelligence Community could greatly benefit from an increased number of employees who are proficient in foreign languages and knowledgeable of world cultures, especially in foreign languages that are critical to the national security interests of the United States. Particular emphasis should be given to the recruitment of United States citizens whose linguistic capabilities are acutely required for the improvement of the overall intelligence collection and analysis effort of the United States Government.

"(3) The Intelligence Community has a significantly lower percentage of women and minorities than the total workforce of the Federal government and the total civilian labor force.

"(4) Women and minorities continue to be under-represented in senior grade levels, and in core mission areas, of the intelligence community."
