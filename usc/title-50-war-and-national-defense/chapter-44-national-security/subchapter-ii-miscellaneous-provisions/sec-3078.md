This title, referred to in text, means title IV of act July 26, 1947, ch. 343, as added Aug. 10, 1949, ch. 412, §11, 63 Stat. 585, which enacted this section and enacted and amended various sections in former Title 5, Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees, and former Title 31, Money and Finance. Title IV of the Act, except for section 411 (this section), was effectively repealed by Pub. L. 87–651, §307, Sept. 7, 1962, 76 Stat. 526, which repealed section 11 of act Aug. 10, 1949, which enacted title IV.

#### Codification ####

Section 6742(b)(11) of Pub. L. 116–92 renumbered section 411 of title IV of act July 26, 1947, as section 312 without corresponding renumbering of title of Act containing the renumbered section. Credit for this section shows section 312 of the Act, as renumbered, as being contained within title III of the Act and not still within title IV, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

Section was classified to section 3006 of this title prior to renumbering by Pub. L. 116–92.

Section was formerly classified to section 412 of this title prior to editorial reclassification and renumbering as section 3006, and to section 172j of former Title 5 prior to the general revision and enactment of Title 5, Government Organization and Employees, by Pub. L. 89–554, §1, Sept. 6, 1966, 80 Stat. 378.
