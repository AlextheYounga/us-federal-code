In addition, such officers or employees may administer oaths or affirmations, and may by subpena require any person to appear and testify or to appear and produce books, records, and other writings, or both, and in the case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpena issued to, any such person, a district court of the United States, after notice to any such person and hearing, shall have jurisdiction to issue an order requiring such person to appear and give testimony or to appear and produce books, records, and other writings, or both, and any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof. In addition to the authority conferred by this paragraph, the Secretary (and officers or employees of the Department of Commerce designated by the Secretary) may conduct, outside the United States, pre-license investigations and post-shipment verifications of items licensed for export, and investigations in the enforcement of section 4607 of this title.

(2)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the United States Customs Service is authorized, in the enforcement of this chapter, to search, detain (after search), and seize goods or technology at those ports of entry or exit from the United States where officers of the Customs Service are authorized by law to conduct such searches, detentions, and seizures, and at those places outside the United States where the Customs Service, pursuant to agreements or other arrangements with other countries, is authorized to perform enforcement activities.

(B) An officer of the United States Customs Service may do the following in carrying out enforcement authority under this chapter:

(i) Stop, search, and examine a vehicle, vessel, aircraft, or person on which or whom such officer has reasonable cause to suspect there are any goods or technology that has been, is being, or is about to be exported from the United States in violation of this chapter.

(ii) Search any package or container in which such officer has reasonable cause to suspect there are any goods or technology that has been, is being, or is about to be exported from the United States in violation of this chapter.

(iii) Detain (after search) or seize and secure for trial any goods or technology on or about such vehicle, vessel, aircraft, or person, or in such package or container, if such officer has probable cause to believe the goods or technology has been, is being, or is about to be exported from the United States in violation of this chapter.

(iv) Make arrests without warrant for any violation of this chapter committed in his or her presence or view or if the officer has probable cause to believe that the person to be arrested has committed or is committing such a violation.

The Customs Service may not detain for more than 20 days any shipment of goods or technology eligible for export under a general license under section 4603(a)(3) of this title. In a case in which such detention is on account of a disagreement between the Secretary and the head of any other department or agency with export license authority under other provisions of law concerning the export license requirements for such goods or technology, such disagreement shall be resolved within that 20-day period. At the end of that 20-day period, the Customs Service shall either release the goods or technology, or seize the goods or technology as authorized by other provisions of law.

The search, detention (after search), or seizure of goods or technology at those ports and places specified in paragraph (2)(A) may be conducted by officers or employees of the Department of Commerce designated by the Secretary with the concurrence of the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection or a person designated by the Commissioner.

(B) The Secretary may designate any employee of the Office of Export Enforcement of the Department of Commerce to do the following in carrying out enforcement authority under this chapter:

(i) Execute any warrant or other process issued by a court or officer of competent jurisdiction with respect to the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.

(iii) Carry firearms in carrying out any activity described in clause (i) or (ii).

(4) The authorities first conferred by the Export Administration Amendments Act of 1985 under paragraph (3) shall be exercised pursuant to guidelines approved by the Attorney General.

#### (c) Confidentiality ####

(1) Except as otherwise provided by the third sentence of section 4607(b)(2) of this title and by section 4610(c)(2)(C) of this title, information obtained under this chapter on or before June 30, 1980, which is deemed confidential, including Shippers' Export Declarations, or with reference to which a request for confidential treatment is made by the person furnishing such information, shall be exempt from disclosure under section 552 of title 5 and such information shall not be published or disclosed unless the Secretary determines that the withholding thereof is contrary to the national interest. Information obtained under this chapter after June 30, 1980, may be withheld only to the extent permitted by statute, except that information obtained for the purpose of consideration of, or concerning, license applications under this chapter shall be withheld from public disclosure unless the release of such information is determined by the Secretary to be in the national interest.

#### (d) Reporting requirements ####

In the administration of this chapter, reporting requirements shall be so designed as to reduce the cost of reporting, recordkeeping, and export documentation required under this chapter to the extent feasible consistent with effective enforcement and compilation of useful trade statistics.
