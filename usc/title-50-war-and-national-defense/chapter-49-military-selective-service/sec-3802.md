Under authority vested in the President by the Military Selective Service Act (62 Stat. 604), as amended [see References in Text note set out under section 3801 of this title], procedures have been established for the registration of male citizens of the United States and of other male persons who are subject to registration under section 3 of said act, as amended (85 Stat. 348) [50 U.S.C. 3802].

Section 3 of the Military Selective Service Act, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 453) [now 50 U.S.C. 3802], provides that male citizens of the United States and other male persons residing in the United States who are between the ages of 18 and 26, except those exempted by Sections 3 and 6(a) of the Military Selective Service Act [50 U.S.C. 3802, 3806(a)], must present themselves for registration at such time or times and place or places, and in such manner as determined by the President. Section 6(k) [50 U.S.C. 3806(k)] provides that such exceptions shall not continue after the cause for the exemption ceases to exist.

The Congress of the United States has made available the funds (H.J. Res. 521, approved by me on June 27, 1980 [Pub. L. 96–282, June 27, 1980, 93 Stat. 552]), which are needed to initiate this registration, beginning with those born on or after January 1, 1960.
