#### (b) Administrative Procedure Act ####

All functions performed under this chapter shall be excluded from the operation of the Administrative Procedure Act (60 Stat. 237) [5 U.S.C. 551 et seq. and 701 et seq.] except as to the requirements of section 3 of such Act [5 U.S.C. 552]. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, no regulation issued under this Act shall become effective until the expiration of thirty days following the date on which such regulation has been published in the Federal Register. After the publication of any regulation and prior to the date on which such regulation becomes effective, any person shall be given an opportunity to submit his views to the Director on such regulation, but no formal hearing shall be required on any such regulation. The requirements of this subsection may be waived by the President in the case of any regulation if he (1) determines that compliance with such requirements would materially impair the national defense, and (2) gives public notice to that effect at the time such regulation is issued.

Each such lumpsum payment shall be prorated for a fractional part of a year of active service in the case of any reserve officer subject to the provisions of either such section, if such reserve officer performs continuous active service for one or more years (inclusive of such service performed during the period in which this chapter is effective) and such active service includes a fractional part of a year immediately prior to June 24, 1948, or immediately following the date on which this chapter shall cease to be effective, or both.
