(b) Reimbursement to States.—

(1) In general.—If a State pays for the cost of relocation of a utility facility necessitated by the construction of a transportation project, Federal funds may be used to reimburse the State for the cost of relocation in the same proportion as Federal funds are expended on the transportation project.

(A) violates the law of the State; or

(B) violates a legal contract between the utility and the State.

(3) Requirement.—A reimbursement under paragraph (1) shall be made only if the State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the State paid the cost of the utility relocation activity from funds of the State with respect to transportation projects for which Federal funds are obligated subsequent to April 16, 1958, for work, including utility relocation activities.

(4) Reimbursement eligibility for early relocation prior to transportation project environmental review process.—

(A) In general.—In addition to the requirements under paragraphs (1) through (3), a State may carry out, at the expense of the State, an early utility relocation project for a transportation project before completion of the environmental review process for the transportation project.

(ii) the State provides adequate documentation to the Secretary of eligible costs incurred by the State for the early utility relocation project;

(iii) before the commencement of the utility relocation activities, an environmental review process was completed for the early utility relocation project that resulted in a finding that the early utility relocation project—
