(I) efforts to reduce the environmental and community impacts of freight movement;

(J) a project to support deployment of alternative fuel vehicles, including—

(i) the acquisition, installation, or operation of publicly accessible electric vehicle charging infrastructure or hydrogen, natural gas, or propane vehicle fueling infrastructure; and

(L) a project described in section 149(b)(5) that does not result in the construction of new capacity; and

(M) a project that reduces transportation emissions at port facilities, including through the advancement of port electrification.

(2) Flexibility.—In addition to the eligible projects under paragraph (1), a State may use funds apportioned under section 104(b)(7) for a project eligible under section 133(b) if the Secretary certifies that the State has demonstrated a reduction in transportation emissions—

(A) as estimated on a per capita basis; and

(B) as estimated on a per unit of economic output basis.

(d) Carbon Reduction Strategy.—

(1) In general.—Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of the Surface Transportation Reauthorization Act of 2021, a State, in consultation with any metropolitan planning organization designated within the State, shall develop a carbon reduction strategy in accordance with this subsection.

(2) Requirements.—The carbon reduction strategy of a State developed under paragraph (1) shall—

(A) support efforts to reduce transportation emissions;

(B) identify projects and strategies to reduce transportation emissions, which may include projects and strategies for safe, reliable, and cost-effective options—

(i) to reduce traffic congestion by facilitating the use of alternatives to single-occupant vehicle trips, including public transportation facilities, pedestrian facilities, bicycle facilities, and shared or pooled vehicle trips within the State or an area served by the applicable metropolitan planning organization, if any;

(ii) to facilitate the use of vehicles or modes of travel that result in lower transportation emissions per person-mile traveled as compared to existing vehicles and modes; and

(iii) to facilitate approaches to the construction of transportation assets that result in lower transportation emissions as compared to existing approaches;

(C) support the reduction of transportation emissions of the State;

(D) at the discretion of the State, quantify the total carbon emissions from the production, transport, and use of materials used in the construction of transportation facilities within the State; and

(E) be appropriate to the population density and context of the State, including any metropolitan planning organization designated within the State.

(3) Updates.—The carbon reduction strategy of a State developed under paragraph (1) shall be updated not less frequently than once every 4 years.

(4) Review.—Not later than 90 days after the date on which a State submits a request for the approval of a carbon reduction strategy developed by the State under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall—

(A) review the process used to develop the carbon reduction strategy; and

(B)(i) certify that the carbon reduction strategy meets the requirements of paragraph (2); or

(ii) deny certification of the carbon reduction strategy and specify the actions necessary for the State to take to correct the deficiencies in the process of the State in developing the carbon reduction strategy.

(5) Technical assistance.—At the request of a State, the Secretary shall provide technical assistance in the development of the carbon reduction strategy under paragraph (1).

(e) Suballocation.—

(1) In general.—For each fiscal year, of the funds apportioned to the State under section 104(b)(7)—

(A) 65 percent shall be obligated, in proportion to their relative shares of the population of the State—

(i) in urbanized areas of the State with an urbanized area population of more than 200,000;

(iii) in urban areas of the State with a population of not less than 5,000 and not more than 49,999; and

(iv) in other areas of the State with a population of less than 5,000; and
