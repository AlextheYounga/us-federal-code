(B) in the case of any other eligible project, not more than 80 percent.

(4) Federal share.—

(A) Maximum federal involvement.—Federal assistance other than a grant under the program may be used to satisfy the non-Federal share of the cost of a project for which a grant is made, except that the total Federal assistance provided for a project receiving a grant under the program may not exceed the Federal share for the project under section 120.

(B) Off-system bridges.—In the case of an eligible project for an off-system bridge (as defined in section 133(f)(1))—
