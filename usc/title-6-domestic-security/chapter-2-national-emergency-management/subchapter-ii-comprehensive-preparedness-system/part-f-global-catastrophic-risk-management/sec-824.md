(C) information campaigns to ensure the public is aware of response plans and services that will be activated when necessary;

#### (c) Assumptions ####

(B) the communication sector;

(C) the energy sector;

(D) the healthcare and public health sector; and

(E) the water and wastewater sector;

(3) State, local, Indian Tribal, and territorial governments have been equally affected or made largely inoperable by catastrophic incidents or the effects of catastrophic incidents;

(4) the emergency has exceeded the response capabilities of State, local, and Indian Tribal governments under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.) and other relevant disaster response laws; and

(5) the United States military is sufficiently engaged in armed or cyber conflict with State or non-State adversaries, or is otherwise unable to augment domestic response capabilities in a significant manner due to a catastrophic incident.
