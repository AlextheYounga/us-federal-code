#### **Editorial Notes** ####

#### References in Text ####

Section 402(a), referred to in subsec. (a), probably should be a reference to section 902(a), meaning section 902(a) of Pub. L. 114–22, which is classified to section 642(a) of this title. Section 402 of Pub. L. 114–22, which is classified to section 21301 of Title 34, Crime Control and Law Enforcement, does not contain a subsec. (a) and does not relate to the training of personnel.

This subchapter, referred to in subsec. (b), was in the original "this title", meaning title IX of Pub. L. 114–22, which is classified principally to this subchapter. For complete classification of title IX to the Code, see Tables.

#### Codification ####

Section was enacted as part of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015, and not as part of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 which comprises this chapter.
