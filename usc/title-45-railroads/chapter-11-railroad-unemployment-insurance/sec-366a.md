#### References in Text ####

The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, referred to in text, is act June 25, 1938, ch. 680, 52 Stat. 1094, which is classified principally to this chapter. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see section 367 of this title and Tables.

The Internal Revenue Code, referred to in text, probably means the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, which was generally repealed by section 7851 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, Title 26. The Internal Revenue Code of 1954 was redesignated the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by Pub. L. 99–514, §2, Oct. 22, 1986, 100 Stat. 2095. For table of comparisons of the 1939 Code to the 1986 Code, see Table I preceding section 1 of Title 26, Internal Revenue Code. See also section 7852(b) of Title 26 for provision that references in any other law to a provision of the 1939 Code, unless expressly incompatible with the intent thereof, shall be deemed a reference to the corresponding provision of the 1986 Code.
