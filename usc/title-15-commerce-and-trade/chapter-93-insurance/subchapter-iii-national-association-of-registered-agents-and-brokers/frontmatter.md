#### Codification ####

Subtitle C of title III of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, comprising this subchapter, was originally enacted by Pub. L. 106–102, title III, Nov. 12, 1999, 113 Stat. 1422. Such subtitle is shown herein, however, as having been added by Pub. L. 114–1, title II, §202(a), Jan. 12, 2015, 129 Stat. 12, because of the extensive revision of subtitle C by Pub. L. 114–1.
