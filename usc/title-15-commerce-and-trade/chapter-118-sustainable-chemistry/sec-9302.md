### §9302. Strategic plan for sustainable chemistry ###

#### (a) Strategic plan ####

Not later than 2 years after January 1, 2021, the Entity shall—

(1) consult with relevant stakeholders, including representatives from industry, academia, national labs, the Federal Government, and international entities, to develop and update, as needed, a consensus definition of "sustainable chemistry" to guide the activities under this chapter;

(2) develop a working framework of attributes characterizing, and metrics for assessing, sustainable chemistry, as described in subsection (b);

(3) assess the state of sustainable chemistry in the United States as a key benchmark from which progress under the activities described in this chapter can be measured, including assessing key sectors of the United States economy, key technology platforms, commercial priorities, and barriers to innovation;

(4) coordinate and support Federal research, development, demonstration, technology transfer, commercialization, education, and training efforts in sustainable chemistry, including budget coordination and support for public-private partnerships, as appropriate;

(5) identify any Federal regulatory barriers to, and opportunities for, Federal agencies facilitating the development of incentives for development, consideration, and use of sustainable chemistry processes and products;

(6) identify major scientific challenges, roadblocks, and hurdles to transformational progress in improving the sustainability of the chemical sciences; and

(7) review, identify, and make effort to eliminate duplicative Federal funding and duplicative Federal research in sustainable chemistry.

#### (b) Characterizing and assessing sustainable chemistry ####

The Entity shall develop a working framework of attributes characterizing, and metrics for assessing, sustainable chemistry for the purposes of carrying out this chapter. In developing this framework, the Entity shall—

(1) seek advice and input from stakeholders as described in subsection (c);

(2) consider existing definitions of, or frameworks characterizing and metrics for assessing, sustainable chemistry already in use at Federal agencies;

(3) consider existing definitions of, or frameworks characterizing and metrics for assessing, sustainable chemistry already in use by international organizations of which the United States is a member, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; and

(4) consider any other appropriate existing definitions of, or frameworks characterizing and metrics for assessing, sustainable chemistry.

#### (c) Consultation ####

In carrying out the duties described in subsections (a) and (b), the Entity shall consult with stakeholders qualified to provide advice and information to guide Federal activities related to sustainable chemistry through workshops, requests for information, or other mechanisms as necessary. The stakeholders shall include representatives from—

(1) business and industry, including trade associations and small- and medium-sized enterprises from across the value chain;

(2) the scientific community, including the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, scientific professional societies, national labs, and academia;

(3) the defense community;

(4) State, tribal, and local governments, including nonregulatory State or regional sustainable chemistry programs, as appropriate;

(5) nongovernmental organizations; and

(6) other appropriate organizations.

#### (d) Report to Congress ####

#### (1) In general ####

Not later than 2 years after January 1, 2021, the Entity shall submit a report to the Committee on Environment and Public Works, the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate, and the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, the Committee on Energy and Commerce, the Committee on Agriculture, the Committee on Education and Labor, and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives. In addition to the elements described in subsections (a) and (b), the report shall include—

(A) a summary of federally funded sustainable chemistry research, development, demonstration, technology transfer, commercialization, education, and training activities;

(B) a summary of the financial resources allocated to sustainable chemistry initiatives by each participating agency;

(C) an assessment of the current state of sustainable chemistry in the United States, including the role that Federal agencies are playing in supporting it;

(D) an analysis of the progress made toward achieving the goals and priorities of this chapter, and recommendations for future program activities;

(E) an evaluation of steps taken and future strategies to avoid duplication of efforts, streamline interagency coordination, facilitate information sharing, and spread best practices among participating agencies; and

(F) an evaluation of duplicative Federal funding and duplicative Federal research in sustainable chemistry, efforts undertaken by the Entity to eliminate duplicative funding and research, and recommendations on how to achieve these goals.

#### (2) Submission to GAO ####

The Entity shall also submit the report described in paragraph (1) to the Comptroller General of the United States for consideration in future Congressional inquiries.

#### (3) Additional reports ####

The Entity shall submit a report to Congress and the Comptroller General of the United States that incorporates the information described in subparagraphs (A), (B), (D), (E), and (F) of paragraph (1) every 3 years, commencing after the initial report is submitted until the Entity terminates.
