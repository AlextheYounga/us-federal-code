### §9025. Pandemic emergency unemployment compensation ###

#### (a) Federal-State agreements ####

#### (1) In general ####

Any State which desires to do so may enter into and participate in an agreement under this section with the Secretary of Labor (in this section referred to as the "Secretary"). Any State which is a party to an agreement under this section may, upon providing 30 days' written notice to the Secretary, terminate such agreement.

#### (2) Provisions of agreement ####

Any agreement under paragraph (1) shall provide that the State agency of the State will make payments of pandemic emergency unemployment compensation to individuals who—

(A) have exhausted all rights to regular compensation under the State law or under Federal law with respect to a benefit year (excluding any benefit year that ended before July 1, 2019);

(B) have no rights to regular compensation with respect to a week under such law or any other State unemployment compensation law or to compensation under any other Federal law;

(C) are not receiving compensation with respect to such week under the unemployment compensation law of Canada; and

(D) are able to work, available to work, and actively seeking work.

#### (3) Exhaustion of benefits ####

For purposes of paragraph (2)(A), an individual shall be deemed to have exhausted such individual's rights to regular compensation under a State law when—

(A) no payments of regular compensation can be made under such law because such individual has received all regular compensation available to such individual based on employment or wages during such individual's base period; or

(B) such individual's rights to such compensation have been terminated by reason of the expiration of the benefit year with respect to which such rights existed.

#### (4) Weekly benefit amount, etc. ####

For purposes of any agreement under this section—

(A) the amount of pandemic emergency unemployment compensation which shall be payable to any individual for any week of total unemployment shall be equal to—

(i) the amount of the regular compensation (including dependents' allowances) payable to such individual during such individual's benefit year under the State law for a week of total unemployment; and

(ii) the amount of Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation under section 9023 of this title;

(B) the terms and conditions of the State law which apply to claims for regular compensation and to the payment thereof (including terms and conditions relating to availability for work, active search for work, and refusal to accept work) shall apply to claims for pandemic emergency unemployment compensation and the payment thereof, except where otherwise inconsistent with the provisions of this section or with the regulations or operating instructions of the Secretary promulgated to carry out this section;

(C) the maximum amount of pandemic emergency unemployment compensation payable to any individual for whom an <sup><a href="#9025_1_target" name="9025_1">1</a></sup> pandemic emergency unemployment compensation account is established under subsection (b) shall not exceed the amount established in such account for such individual; and

(D) the allowable methods of payment under section 9023(b)(2) of this title shall apply to payments of amounts described in subparagraph (A)(ii).

#### (5) Coordination rule ####

An agreement under this section shall apply with respect to a State only upon a determination by the Secretary that, under the State law or other applicable rules of such State, the payment of extended compensation for which an individual is otherwise eligible must be deferred until after the payment of any pandemic emergency unemployment compensation under subsection (b) for which the individual is concurrently eligible.

#### (6) Nonreduction rule ####

#### (A) In general ####

An agreement under this section shall not apply (or shall cease to apply) with respect to a State upon a determination by the Secretary that the method governing the computation of regular compensation under the State law of that State has been modified in a manner such that the number of weeks (the maximum benefit entitlement), or the average weekly benefit amount, of regular compensation which will be payable during the period of the agreement will be less than the number of weeks, or the average weekly benefit amount, of the average weekly benefit amount of regular compensation which would otherwise have been payable during such period under the State law, as in effect on January 1, 2020.

#### (B) Maximum benefit entitlement ####

In subparagraph (A), the term "maximum benefit entitlement" means the amount of regular unemployment compensation payable to an individual with respect to the individual's benefit year.

#### (7) Actively seeking work ####

#### (A) In general ####

Subject to subparagraph (C),<sup><a href="#9025_2_target" name="9025_2">2</a></sup> for purposes of paragraph (2)(D), the term "actively seeking work" means, with respect to any individual, that such individual—

(i) is registered for employment services in such a manner and to such extent as prescribed by the State agency;

(ii) has engaged in an active search for employment that is appropriate in light of the employment available in the labor market, the individual's skills and capabilities, and includes a number of employer contacts that is consistent with the standards communicated to the individual by the State;

(iii) has maintained a record of such work search, including employers contacted, method of contact, and date contacted; and

(iv) when requested, has provided such work search record to the State agency.

#### (B) Flexibility ####

Notwithstanding the requirements under subparagraph (A) and paragraph (2)(D), a State shall provide flexibility in meeting such requirements in case of individuals unable to search for work because of COVID–19, including because of illness, quarantine, or movement restriction.

#### (b) Pandemic emergency unemployment compensation account ####

#### (1) In general ####

Any agreement under this section shall provide that the State will establish, for each eligible individual who files an application for pandemic emergency unemployment compensation, an <sup><a href="#9025_1_target" name="9025_1">1</a></sup> pandemic emergency unemployment compensation account with respect to such individual's benefit year.

#### (2) Amount in account ####

The amount established in an account under subsection (a) shall be equal to 13 times the individual's average weekly benefit amount, which includes the amount of Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation under section 9023 of this title, for the benefit year.

#### (3) Weekly benefit amount ####

For purposes of this subsection, an individual's weekly benefit amount for any week is the amount of regular compensation (including dependents' allowances) under the State law payable to such individual for such week for total unemployment plus the amount of Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation under section 9023 of this title.

#### (c) Payments to States having agreements for the payment of pandemic emergency unemployment compensation ####

No payment shall be made to any State under this section in respect of any compensation to the extent the State is entitled to reimbursement in respect of such compensation under the provisions of any Federal law other than this section or chapter 85 of title 5. A State shall not be entitled to any reimbursement under such chapter 85 in respect of any compensation to the extent the State is entitled to reimbursement under this section in respect of such compensation.

#### (3) Determination of amount ####

Sums payable to any State by reason of such State having an agreement under this section shall be payable, either in advance or by way of reimbursement (as may be determined by the Secretary), in such amounts as the Secretary estimates the State will be entitled to receive under this section for each calendar month, reduced or increased, as the case may be, by any amount by which the Secretary finds that the Secretary's estimates for any prior calendar month were greater or less than the amounts which should have been paid to the State. Such estimates may be made on the basis of such statistical, sampling, or other method as may be agreed upon by the Secretary and the State agency of the State involved.
