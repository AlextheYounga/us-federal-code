#### (a) Federal-State agreements ####

#### (1) In general ####

Any State which desires to do so may enter into and participate in an agreement under this section with the Secretary of Labor (in this section referred to as the "Secretary"). Any State which is a party to an agreement under this section may, upon providing 30 days' written notice to the Secretary, terminate such agreement.

#### (2) Provisions of agreement ####

Any agreement under paragraph (1) shall provide that the State agency of the State will make payments of pandemic emergency unemployment compensation to individuals who—

(A) have exhausted all rights to regular compensation under the State law or under Federal law with respect to a benefit year (excluding any benefit year that ended before July 1, 2019);

(B) have no rights to regular compensation with respect to a week under such law or any other State unemployment compensation law or to compensation under any other Federal law;

(C) are not receiving compensation with respect to such week under the unemployment compensation law of Canada; and

(D) are able to work, available to work, and actively seeking work.

#### (3) Exhaustion of benefits ####

For purposes of paragraph (2)(A), an individual shall be deemed to have exhausted such individual's rights to regular compensation under a State law when—

(A) no payments of regular compensation can be made under such law because such individual has received all regular compensation available to such individual based on employment or wages during such individual's base period; or

(B) such individual's rights to such compensation have been terminated by reason of the expiration of the benefit year with respect to which such rights existed.

#### (4) Weekly benefit amount, etc. ####

For purposes of any agreement under this section—

(A) the amount of pandemic emergency unemployment compensation which shall be payable to any individual for any week of total unemployment shall be equal to—

(i) the amount of the regular compensation (including dependents' allowances) payable to such individual during such individual's benefit year under the State law for a week of total unemployment;

(ii) the amount of Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation under section 9023(b)(1)(B) of this title; and

(iii) the amount (if any) of Mixed Earner Unemployment Compensation under section 9023(b)(1)(C) of this title;

(B) the terms and conditions of the State law which apply to claims for regular compensation and to the payment thereof (including terms and conditions relating to availability for work, active search for work, and refusal to accept work) shall apply to claims for pandemic emergency unemployment compensation and the payment thereof, except where otherwise inconsistent with the provisions of this section or with the regulations or operating instructions of the Secretary promulgated to carry out this section;

(C) the maximum amount of pandemic emergency unemployment compensation payable to any individual for whom an <sup><a href="#9025_1_target" name="9025_1">1</a></sup> pandemic emergency unemployment compensation account is established under subsection (b) shall not exceed the amount established in such account for such individual; and

(D) the allowable methods of payment under section 9023(b)(2) of this title shall apply to payments of amounts described in subparagraph (A)(ii).

#### (5) Coordination rules ####

#### (A) In general ####

Subject to subparagraph (B), an agreement under this section shall apply with respect to a State only upon a determination by the Secretary that, under the State law or other applicable rules of such State, the payment of extended compensation for which an individual is otherwise eligible must be deferred until after the payment of any pandemic emergency unemployment compensation under subsection (b) for which the individual is concurrently eligible.

#### (B) Special rule ####

In the case of an individual who is receiving extended compensation under the State law for the week that includes December 27, 2020 (without regard to the amendments made by subsections (a) and (b) of section 206 of the Continued Assistance for Unemployed Workers Act of 2020) or for the week that includes March 11, 2021 (without regard to the amendments made by subsections (a) and (b) of section 9016 of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021), such individual shall not be eligible to receive pandemic emergency unemployment compensation by reason of such amendments until such individual has exhausted all rights to such extended benefits.

#### (6) Nonreduction rule ####

#### (A) In general ####

An agreement under this section shall not apply (or shall cease to apply) with respect to a State upon a determination by the Secretary that the method governing the computation of regular compensation under the State law of that State has been modified in a manner such that the number of weeks (the maximum benefit entitlement), or the average weekly benefit amount, of regular compensation which will be payable during the period of the agreement will be less than the number of weeks, or the average weekly benefit amount, of the average weekly benefit amount of regular compensation which would otherwise have been payable during such period under the State law, as in effect on January 1, 2020.

#### (B) Maximum benefit entitlement ####

In subparagraph (A), the term "maximum benefit entitlement" means the amount of regular unemployment compensation payable to an individual with respect to the individual's benefit year.

#### (7) Actively seeking work ####

#### (A) In general ####

Subject to subparagraph (C),<sup><a href="#9025_2_target" name="9025_2">2</a></sup> for purposes of paragraph (2)(D), the term "actively seeking work" means, with respect to any individual, that such individual—

(i) is registered for employment services in such a manner and to such extent as prescribed by the State agency;

(ii) has engaged in an active search for employment that is appropriate in light of the employment available in the labor market, the individual's skills and capabilities, and includes a number of employer contacts that is consistent with the standards communicated to the individual by the State;

(iii) has maintained a record of such work search, including employers contacted, method of contact, and date contacted; and

(iv) when requested, has provided such work search record to the State agency.

#### (B) Flexibility ####

Notwithstanding the requirements under subparagraph (A) and paragraph (2)(D), a State shall provide flexibility in meeting such requirements in case of individuals unable to search for work because of COVID–19, including because of illness, quarantine, or movement restriction.

#### (8) Special rule for extended compensation ####

At the option of a State, for any weeks of unemployment beginning after December 27, 2020, and before September 6, 2021, an individual's eligibility period (as described in section 203(c) of the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 (26 U.S.C. 3304 note)) shall, for purposes of any determination of eligibility for extended compensation under the State law of such State, be considered to include any week which begins—

(A) after the date as of which such individual exhausts all rights to pandemic emergency unemployment compensation; and

(B) during an extended benefit period that began on or before the date described in subparagraph (A).

#### (b) Pandemic emergency unemployment compensation account ####

#### (1) In general ####

Any agreement under this section shall provide that the State will establish, for each eligible individual who files an application for pandemic emergency unemployment compensation, an <sup><a href="#9025_1_target" name="9025_1">1</a></sup> pandemic emergency unemployment compensation account with respect to such individual's benefit year.

#### (2) Amount in account ####

The amount established in an account under subsection (a) shall be equal to 53 times the individual's average weekly benefit amount, which includes the amount of Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation under section 9023 of this title, for the benefit year.

#### (3) Weekly benefit amount ####

For purposes of this subsection, an individual's weekly benefit amount for any week is the amount of regular compensation (including dependents' allowances) under the State law payable to such individual for such week for total unemployment plus the amount of Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation under section 9023 of this title.

#### (4) Coordination of pandemic emergency unemployment compensation with regular compensation ####

#### (A) In general ####

If—

(i) an individual has been determined to be entitled to pandemic emergency unemployment compensation with respect to a benefit year;

(ii) that benefit year has expired;

(iii) that individual has remaining entitlement to pandemic emergency unemployment compensation with respect to that benefit year; and

(iv) that individual would qualify for a new benefit year in which the weekly benefit amount of regular compensation is at least $25 less than the individual's weekly benefit amount in the benefit year referred to in clause (i),

then the State shall determine eligibility for compensation as provided in subparagraph (B).

#### (B) Determination of eligibility ####

For individuals described in subparagraph (A), the State shall determine whether the individual is to be paid pandemic emergency unemployment compensation or regular compensation for a week of unemployment using one of the following methods:

(i) The State shall, if permitted by State law, establish a new benefit year, but defer the payment of regular compensation with respect to that new benefit year until exhaustion of all pandemic emergency unemployment compensation payable with respect to the benefit year referred to in subparagraph (A)(i).

(ii) The State shall, if permitted by State law, defer the establishment of a new benefit year (which uses all the wages and employment which would have been used to establish a benefit year but for the application of this subparagraph), until exhaustion of all pandemic emergency unemployment compensation payable with respect to the benefit year referred to in subparagraph (A)(i).

(iii) The State shall pay, if permitted by State law—

(I) regular compensation equal to the weekly benefit amount established under the new benefit year; and

(II) pandemic emergency unemployment compensation equal to the difference between that weekly benefit amount and the weekly benefit amount for the expired benefit year.

(iv) The State shall determine rights to pandemic emergency unemployment compensation without regard to any rights to regular compensation if the individual elects to not file a claim for regular compensation under the new benefit year.

#### (c) Payments to States having agreements for the payment of pandemic emergency unemployment compensation ####

#### (1) In general ####

There shall be paid to each State that has entered into an agreement under this section an amount equal to 100 percent of the pandemic emergency unemployment compensation paid to individuals by the State pursuant to such agreement.

#### (2) Treatment of reimbursable compensation ####

No payment shall be made to any State under this section in respect of any compensation to the extent the State is entitled to reimbursement in respect of such compensation under the provisions of any Federal law other than this section or chapter 85 of title 5. A State shall not be entitled to any reimbursement under such chapter 85 in respect of any compensation to the extent the State is entitled to reimbursement under this section in respect of such compensation.

#### (3) Determination of amount ####

Sums payable to any State by reason of such State having an agreement under this section shall be payable, either in advance or by way of reimbursement (as may be determined by the Secretary), in such amounts as the Secretary estimates the State will be entitled to receive under this section for each calendar month, reduced or increased, as the case may be, by any amount by which the Secretary finds that the Secretary's estimates for any prior calendar month were greater or less than the amounts which should have been paid to the State. Such estimates may be made on the basis of such statistical, sampling, or other method as may be agreed upon by the Secretary and the State agency of the State involved.
