### §9011. Subsidy for certain loan payments ###

#### (a) Definition of covered loan ####

In this section, the term "covered loan" means a loan that is—

(1) guaranteed by the Administration under—

(A) section 636(a) of this title—

(i) including a loan made under the Community Advantage Pilot Program of the Administration; and

(ii) excluding a loan made under paragraph (36) of such section 636(a) of this title, as added by section 1102; or

(B) title V of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (15 U.S.C. 695 et seq.); or

(2) made by an intermediary to a small business concern using loans or grants received under section 636(m) of this title.

#### (b) Sense of Congress ####

It is the sense of Congress that—

(1) all borrowers are adversely affected by COVID–19;

(2) relief payments by the Administration are appropriate for all borrowers; and

(3) in addition to the relief provided under this Act, the Administration should encourage lenders to provide payment deferments, when appropriate, and to extend the maturity of covered loans, so as to avoid balloon payments or any requirement for increases in debt payments resulting from deferments provided by lenders during the period of the national emergency declared by the President under the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) with respect to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID–19).

#### (c) Principal and interest payments ####

#### (1) In general ####

(A) With respect to a covered loan made before March 27, 2020, and not on deferment, the Administrator shall make those payments as follows:

(i) The Administrator shall make those payments for the 6-month period beginning with the next payment due on the covered loan.

(bb) the first month after the payments under clause (i) are complete.

The Administrator shall monitor whether amounts made available to make payments under this subsection are sufficient to make the payments for the periods described in paragraph (1).

If the Administrator determines under subparagraph (A) that the amounts made available to make payments under this subsection are insufficient, the Administrator shall—

(B) not more than 90 days after a payment default.

#### (e) Rule of construction ####

Nothing in this section may be construed to limit the authority of the Administrator to make payments pursuant to subsection (c) with respect to a covered loan solely because the covered loan has been sold in the secondary market.
