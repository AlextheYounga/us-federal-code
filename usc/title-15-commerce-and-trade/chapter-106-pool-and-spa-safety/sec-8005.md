In establishing minimum State law requirements under paragraph (1)(B), the Commission shall—

(A) consider current or revised national performance standards on pool and spa barrier protection and entrapment prevention; and

(B) ensure that any such requirements are consistent with the guidelines contained in the Commission's publication 362, entitled "Safety Barrier Guidelines for Home Pools", the Commission's publication entitled "Guidelines for Entrapment Hazards: Making Pools and Spas Safer", and any other pool safety guidelines established by the Commission.

#### (A) Safety vacuum release system ####

A safety vacuum release system which ceases operation of the pump, reverses the circulation flow, or otherwise provides a vacuum release at a suction outlet when a blockage is detected, that has been tested by an independent third party and found to conform to ASME/ANSI standard A112.19.17 or ASTM standard F2387, or any successor standard.

#### (B) Suction-limiting vent system ####

A suction-limiting vent system with a tamper-resistant atmospheric opening.
