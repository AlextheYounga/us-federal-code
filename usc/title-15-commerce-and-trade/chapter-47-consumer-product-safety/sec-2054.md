#### “SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. ####

“(a) Short Title.—This Act may be cited as the ‘Fire Safe Cigarette Act of 1990’.

“(b) Findings.—The Congress finds that—

“(1) cigarette-ignited fires are the leading cause of fire deaths in the United States,

“(2) in 1987, there were 1,492 deaths from cigarette-ignited fires, 3,809 serious injuries, and $395,000,000 in property damage caused by such fires,

“(3) the final report of the Technical Study Group on Cigarette and Little Cigar Fire Safety under the Cigarette Safety Act of 1984 [set out below] determined that (A) it is technically feasible and may be commercially feasible to develop a cigarette that will have a significantly reduced propensity to ignite furniture and mattresses, and (B) the overall impact on other aspects of the United States society and economy may be minimal,

“(4) the final report of the Technical Study Group on Cigarette and Little Cigar Fire Safety under the Cigarette Safety Act of 1984 further determined that the value of a cigarette with less of a likelihood to ignite furniture and mattresses which would prevent property damage and personal injury and loss of life is economically incalculable,

“(5) it is appropriate for the Congress to require by law the completion of the research described in the final report of the Technical Study Group on Cigarette and Little Cigar Fire Safety and an assessment of the practicability of developing a performance standard to reduce cigarette ignition propensity, and

“(6) it is appropriate for the Consumer Product Safety Commission to utilize its expertise to complete the recommendations for further work and report to Congress in a timely fashion.

#### “SEC. 2. COMPLETION OF FIRE SAFETY RESEARCH. ####

“(a) Center for Fire Research.—At the request of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the National Institute for Standards and Technology's Center for Fire Research shall—

“(1) develop a standard test method to determine cigarette ignition propensity,

“(2) compile performance data for cigarettes using the standard test method developed under paragraph (1), and

“(3) conduct laboratory studies on and computer modeling of ignition physics to develop valid, user-friendly predictive capability.

The Commission shall make such request not later than the expiration of 30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act [Aug. 10, 1990].

“(b) Commission.—The Consumer Product Safety Commission shall—

“(1) design and implement a study to collect baseline and followup data about the characteristics of cigarettes, products ignited, and smokers involved in fires, and

“(2) develop information on societal costs of cigarette-ignited fires.

“(c) Health and Human Services.—The Consumer Product Safety Commission, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall develop information on changes in the toxicity of smoke and resultant health effects from cigarette prototypes. The Commission shall not obligate more than $50,000 to develop such information.

#### “SEC. 3. ADVISORY GROUP. ####

“(a) Establishment.—There is established the Technical Advisory Group to advise and work with the Consumer Product Safety Commission and National Institute for Standards and Technology's Center for Fire Research on the implementation of this Act. The Technical Advisory Group may hold hearings to develop information to carry out its functions. The Technical Advisory Group shall terminate 1 month after the submission of the final report of the Chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission under section 4.

“(b) Members.—The Technical Advisory Group shall consist of the same individuals appointed to the Technical Study Group on Cigarette and Little Cigar Fire Safety under section 3(a) of the Cigarette Safety Act of 1984 [set out below]. If such an individual is unavailable to serve on the Technical Advisory Group, the entity which such individual represented on such Technical Study Group shall submit to the Chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission the name of another individual to be appointed by the Chairman to represent such group on the Technical Advisory Group.
