### §9204. Generative adversarial network defined ###

In this chapter, the term "generative adversarial network" means, with respect to artificial intelligence, the machine learning process of attempting to cause a generator artificial neural network (referred to in this section as the "generator" <sup><a href="#9204_1_target" name="9204_1">1</a></sup> and a discriminator artificial neural network (referred to in this section as a "discriminator") to compete against each other to become more accurate in their function and outputs, through which the generator and discriminator create a feedback loop, causing the generator to produce increasingly higher-quality artificial outputs and the discriminator to increasingly improve in detecting such artificial outputs.
