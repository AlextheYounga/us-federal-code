### §3055. Horseracing anti-doping and medication control program ###

#### (a) Program required ####

#### (1) In general ####

Not later than the program effective date, and after notice and an opportunity for public comment in accordance with section 3053 of this title, the Authority shall establish a horseracing anti-doping and medication control program applicable to all covered horses, covered persons, and covered horseraces in accordance with the registration of covered persons under section 3054(d) of this title.

#### (2) Consideration of other breeds ####

In developing the horseracing anti-doping and medication control program with respect to a breed of horse that is made subject to this chapter by election of a State racing commission or the breed governing organization for such horse under section 3054(k) <sup><a href="#3055_1_target" name="3055_1">1</a></sup> of this title, the Authority shall consider the unique characteristics of such breed.

#### (b) Considerations in development of program ####

In developing the horseracing anti-doping and medication control program, the Authority shall take into consideration the following:

(1) Covered horses should compete only when they are free from the influence of medications, other foreign substances, and methods that affect their performance.

(2) Covered horses that are injured or unsound should not train or participate in covered races, and the use of medications, other foreign substances, and treatment methods that mask or deaden pain in order to allow injured or unsound horses to train or race should be prohibited.

(3) Rules, standards, procedures, and protocols regulating medication and treatment methods for covered horses and covered races should be uniform and uniformly administered nationally.

(4) To the extent consistent with this chapter, consideration should be given to international anti-doping and medication control standards of the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities and the Principles of Veterinary Medical Ethics of the American Veterinary Medical Association.

(5) The administration of medications and treatment methods to covered horses should be based upon an examination and diagnosis that identifies an issue requiring treatment for which the medication or method represents an appropriate component of treatment.

(6) The amount of therapeutic medication that a covered horse receives should be the minimum necessary to address the diagnosed health concerns identified during the examination and diagnostic process.

(7) The welfare of covered horses, the integrity of the sport, and the confidence of the betting public require full disclosure to regulatory authorities regarding the administration of medications and treatments to covered horses.

#### (c) Activities ####

The following activities shall be carried out under the horseracing anti-doping and medication control program:

#### (1) Standards for anti-doping and medication control ####

Not later than 120 days before the program effective date, the Authority shall issue, by rule—

(A) uniform standards for—

(i) the administration of medication to covered horses by covered persons; and

(ii) laboratory testing accreditation and protocols; and

(B) a list of permitted and prohibited medications, substances, and methods, including allowable limits of permitted medications, substances, and methods.

#### (2) Review process for administration of medication ####

The development of a review process for the administration of any medication to a covered horse during the 48-hour period preceding the next racing start of the covered horse.

#### (3) Agreement requirements ####

The development of requirements with respect to agreements under section 3054(e) of this title.

#### (4) Anti-doping and medication control enforcement agency ####

#### (A) Control rules, protocols, etc ####

Except as provided in paragraph (5), the anti-doping and medication control program enforcement agency under section 3054(e) of this title shall, in consultation with the anti-doping and medication control standing committee of the Authority and consistent with international best practices, develop and recommend anti-doping and medication control rules, protocols, policies, and guidelines for approval by the Authority.

#### (B) Results management ####

The anti-doping and medication control enforcement agency shall conduct and oversee anti-doping and medication control results management, including independent investigations, charging and adjudication of potential medication control rule violations, and the enforcement of any civil sanctions for such violations. Any final decision or civil sanction of the anti-doping and medication control enforcement agency under this subparagraph shall be the final decision or civil sanction of the Authority, subject to review in accordance with section 3058 of this title.

#### (C) Testing ####

The anti-doping enforcement agency shall perform and manage test distribution planning (including intelligence-based testing), the sample collection process, and in-competition and out-of-competition testing (including no-advance-notice testing).

#### (D) Testing laboratories ####

The anti-doping and medication control enforcement agency shall accredit testing laboratories based upon the standards established under this chapter, and shall monitor, test, and audit accredited laboratories to ensure continuing compliance with accreditation standards.

#### (5) Anti-doping and medication control standing committee ####

The anti-doping and medication control standing committee shall, in consultation with the anti-doping and medication control enforcement agency, develop lists of permitted and prohibited medications, methods, and substances for recommendation to, and approval by, the Authority. Any such list may prohibit the administration of any substance or method to a horse at any time after such horse becomes a covered horse if the Authority determines such substance or method has a long-term degrading effect on the soundness of a horse.

#### (d) Prohibition ####

Except as provided in subsections (e) and (f), the horseracing anti-doping and medication control program shall prohibit the administration of any prohibited or otherwise permitted substance to a covered horse within 48 hours of its next racing start, effective as of the program effective date.

#### (e) Advisory committee study and report ####

#### (1) In general ####

Not later than the program effective date, the Authority shall convene an advisory committee comprised of horseracing anti-doping and medication control industry experts, including a member designated by the anti-doping and medication control enforcement agency, to conduct a study on the use of furosemide on horses during the 48-hour period before the start of a race, including the effect of furosemide on equine health and the integrity of competition and any other matter the Authority considers appropriate.

#### (2) Report ####

Not later than three years after the program effective date, the Authority shall direct the advisory committee convened under paragraph (1) to submit to the Authority a written report on the study conducted under that paragraph that includes recommended changes, if any, to the prohibition in subsection (d).

#### (3) Modification of prohibition ####

#### (A) In general ####

#### (f) Exemption ####

#### (1) In general ####

Except as provided in paragraph (2), only during the three-year period beginning on the program effective date, a State racing commission may submit to the Authority, at such time and in such manner as the Authority may require, a request for an exemption from the prohibition in subsection (d) with respect to the use of furosemide on covered horses during such period.
