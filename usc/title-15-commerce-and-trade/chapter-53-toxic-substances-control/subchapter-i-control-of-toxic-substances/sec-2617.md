#### (1) In general ####

Except as provided in subsections (c), (d), (e), (f), and (g), beginning on the date on which the Administrator defines the scope of a risk evaluation for a chemical substance under section 2605(b)(4)(D) of this title and ending on the date on which the deadline established pursuant to section 2605(b)(4)(G) of this title for completion of the risk evaluation expires, or on the date on which the Administrator publishes the risk evaluation under section 2605(b)(4)(C) of this title, whichever is earlier, no State or political subdivision of a State may establish a statute, criminal penalty, or administrative action prohibiting or otherwise restricting the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, or use of such chemical substance that is a high-priority substance designated under section 2605(b)(1)(B)(i) of this title.

#### (2) Effect of subsection ####

This subsection does not restrict the authority of a State or political subdivision of a State to continue to enforce any statute enacted, criminal penalty assessed, or administrative action taken, prior to the date on which the Administrator defines and publishes the scope of a risk evaluation under section 2605(b)(4)(D) of this title.

#### (d) Exceptions ####

#### (1) No preemption of statutes and administrative actions ####

#### (A) In general ####

Nothing in this chapter, nor any amendment made by the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, nor any rule, standard of performance, risk evaluation, or scientific assessment implemented pursuant to this chapter, shall affect the right of a State or a political subdivision of a State to adopt or enforce any rule, standard of performance, risk evaluation, scientific assessment, or any other protection for public health or the environment that—

(i) is adopted or authorized under the authority of any other Federal law or adopted to satisfy or obtain authorization or approval under any other Federal law;

(ii) implements a reporting, monitoring, or other information obligation for the chemical substance not otherwise required by the Administrator under this chapter or required under any other Federal law;

(iii) is adopted pursuant to authority under a law of the State or political subdivision of the State related to water quality, air quality, or waste treatment or disposal, except to the extent that the action—

(I) imposes a restriction on the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, or use of a chemical substance; and

(II)(aa) addresses the same hazards and exposures, with respect to the same conditions of use as are included in the scope of the risk evaluation published pursuant to section 2605(b)(4)(D) of this title, but is inconsistent with the action of the Administrator; or

(bb) would cause a violation of the applicable action by the Administrator under section 2604 or 2605 of this title; or

#### (B) Identical requirements ####

#### (i) In general ####

In the case of an identical requirement—

(I) a State or political subdivision of a State may not assess a penalty for a specific violation for which the Administrator has assessed an adequate penalty under section 2615 of this title; and

(II) if a State or political subdivision of a State has assessed a penalty for a specific violation, the Administrator may not assess a penalty for that violation in an amount that would cause the total of the penalties assessed for the violation by the State or political subdivision of a State and the Administrator combined to exceed the maximum amount that may be assessed for that violation by the Administrator under section 2615 of this title.

#### (2) Applicability to certain rules or orders ####

#### (A) Prior rules and orders ####

Nothing in this section shall be construed as modifying the preemptive effect under this section, as in effect on the day before the effective date of the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, of any rule or order promulgated or issued under this chapter prior to that effective date.

#### (B) Certain chemical substances and mixtures ####

With respect to a chemical substance or mixture for which any rule or order was promulgated or issued under section 2605 of this title prior to the effective date of the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act with respect to manufacturing, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of the chemical substance or mixture, nothing in this section shall be construed as modifying the preemptive effect of this section as in effect prior to the enactment of the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act of any rule or order that is promulgated or issued with respect to such chemical substance or mixture under section 2605 of this title after that effective date, unless the latter rule or order is with respect to a chemical substance or mixture containing a chemical substance and follows a designation of that chemical substance as a high-priority substance under section 2605(b)(1)(B)(i) of this title, the identification of that chemical substance under section 2605(b)(2)(A) of this title, or the selection of that chemical substance for risk evaluation under section 2605(b)(4)(E)(iv)(II) of this title.

#### (e) Preservation of certain laws ####

#### (1) In general ####

Nothing in this chapter, subject to subsection (g) of this section, shall—

#### (1) Discretionary exemptions ####

Upon application of a State or political subdivision of a State, the Administrator may, by rule, exempt from subsection (a), under such conditions as may be prescribed in the rule, a statute, criminal penalty, or administrative action of that State or political subdivision of the State that relates to the effects of exposure to a chemical substance under the conditions of use if the Administrator determines that—

(A) compelling conditions warrant granting the waiver to protect health or the environment;

(B) compliance with the proposed requirement of the State or political subdivision of the State would not unduly burden interstate commerce in the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, or use of a chemical substance;

(C) compliance with the proposed requirement of the State or political subdivision of the State would not cause a violation of any applicable Federal law, rule, or order; and

(i) consistent with the best available science;

(ii) using supporting studies conducted in accordance with sound and objective scientific practices; and

(iii) based on the weight of the scientific evidence.

#### (2) Required exemptions ####

Upon application of a State or political subdivision of a State, the Administrator shall exempt from subsection (b) a statute or administrative action of a State or political subdivision of a State that relates to the effects of exposure to a chemical substance under the conditions of use if the Administrator determines that—
