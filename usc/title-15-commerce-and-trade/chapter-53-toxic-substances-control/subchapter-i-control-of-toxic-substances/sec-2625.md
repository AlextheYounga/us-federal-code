#### (b) Fees ####

(1) The Administrator may, by rule, require the payment from any person required to submit information under section 2603 of this title or a notice or other information to be reviewed by the Administrator under section 2604 of this title, or who manufactures or processes a chemical substance that is the subject of a risk evaluation under section 2605(b) of this title, of a fee that is sufficient and not more than reasonably necessary to defray the cost related to such chemical substance of administering sections 2603, 2604, and 2605 of this title, and collecting, processing, reviewing, and providing access to and protecting from disclosure as appropriate under section 2613 of this title information on chemical substances under this subchapter, including contractor costs incurred by the Administrator. In setting a fee under this paragraph, the Administrator shall take into account the ability to pay of the person required to pay such fee and the cost to the Administrator of carrying out the activities described in this paragraph.
