### §2936. Scientific assessment ###

On a periodic basis (not less frequently than every 4 years), the Council, through the Committee, shall prepare and submit to the President and the Congress an assessment which—

(1) integrates, evaluates, and interprets the findings of the Program and discusses the scientific uncertainties associated with such findings;

(2) analyzes the effects of global change on the natural environment, agriculture, energy production and use, land and water resources, transportation, human health and welfare, human social systems, and biological diversity; and

(3) analyzes current trends in global change, both human-inducted <sup><a href="#2936_1_target" name="2936_1">1</a></sup> and natural, and projects major trends for the subsequent 25 to 100 years.
