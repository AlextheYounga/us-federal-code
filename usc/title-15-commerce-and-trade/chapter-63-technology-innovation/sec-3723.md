#### Developing STEM Apprenticeships ####

Pub. L. 114–329, title III, §312(a)–(d), Jan. 6, 2017, 130 Stat. 3013, 3014, provided that:

"(a) Findings.—Congress makes the following findings:

"(1) The lack of data on the return on investment for United States employers using registered apprenticeships makes it difficult—

"(A) to communicate the value of these programs to businesses; and

"(B) to expand registered apprenticeships.

"(2) The lack of data on the value and impact of employer-provided worker training, which is likely substantial, hinders the ability of the Federal Government to formulate policy related to workforce training.

"(3) The Secretary of Commerce has initiated—

"(A) the first study on the return on investment for United States employers using registered apprenticeships through case studies of firms in various sectors, occupations, and geographic locations to provide the business community with data on employer benefits and costs; and

"(B) discussions with officials at relevant Federal agencies about the need to collect comprehensive data on—

"(i) employer-provided worker training; and

"(ii) existing tools that could be used to collect such data.

"(b) Development of Apprenticeship Information.—The Secretary of Commerce shall continue to research the value to businesses of utilizing apprenticeship programs, including—

"(1) evidence of return on investment of apprenticeships, including estimates for the average time it takes a business to recover the costs associated with training apprentices; and

"(2) data from the United States Census Bureau and other statistical surveys on employer-provided training, including apprenticeships and other on-the-job training and industry-recognized certification programs.

"(c) Dissemination of Apprenticeship Information.—The Secretary of Commerce shall disseminate findings from research on apprenticeships to businesses and other relevant stakeholders, including—

"(1) institutions of higher education;

"(2) State and local chambers of commerce; and

"(3) workforce training organizations.

"(d) New Apprenticeship Program Study.—The Secretary of Commerce may collaborate with the Secretary of Labor to study approaches for reducing the cost of creating new apprenticeship programs and hosting apprentices for businesses, particularly small businesses, including—

"(1) training sharing agreements;

"(2) group training models; and

"(3) pooling resources and best practices."
