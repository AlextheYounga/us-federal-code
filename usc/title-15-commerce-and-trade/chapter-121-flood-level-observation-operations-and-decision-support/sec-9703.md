### §9703. Observations and modeling for total water prediction ###

#### (a) Partnerships ####

#### (1) In general ####

The Administrator shall establish partnerships with 1 or more institutions of higher education (as defined in section 1001 of title 20) to evaluate observations that would improve total water prediction.

#### (2) Priority observations ####

In establishing partnerships under paragraph (1), the Administrator shall prioritize partnerships to evaluate observations from uncrewed aerial systems.

#### (b) Maintained observations ####

If the Administrator determines that incorporating additional observations improves total water prediction, the Administrator shall, to the extent practicable, continue incorporating those observations.

#### (c) Modeling improvements ####

The Administrator shall advance geographic coverage, resolution, skill, and efficiency of coastal oceanographic modeling, including efforts that improve the coupling of and interoperability between hydrological models and coastal ocean models.
