#### References in Text ####

This chapter, referred to in subsecs. (d) and (e), was in the original "this division", meaning div. E of Pub. L. 116–283, Jan. 1, 2021, 134 Stat. 4523, which is classified principally to this chapter. For complete classification of division E to the Code, see Short Title note set out below and Tables.

50 U.S.C. 3003, referred to in subsec. (d)(1), was so in the original, but probably should have been a reference to section 3 of the National Security Act of 1947, act July 26, 1947, ch. 343, which is classified to section 3003 of Title 50, War and National Defense.
