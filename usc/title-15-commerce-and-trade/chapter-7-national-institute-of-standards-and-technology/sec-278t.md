### §278t. Advanced communications research activities ###

#### (a) Advanced communications research ####

#### (1) In general ####

The Director, in consultation with the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information, the Director of the National Science Foundation, and heads of other Federal agencies, as appropriate, shall carry out a program of measurement research for advanced communications technologies.

#### (2) Research areas ####

Research areas may include—

(A) radio frequency emissions and interference, including technologies and techniques to mitigate such emissions and interference;

(B) advanced antenna arrays and artificial intelligence systems capable of operating advanced antenna arrays;

(C) artificial intelligence systems to enable internet of things networks, immersive technology, and other advanced communications technologies;

(D) network sensing and monitoring technologies;

(E) technologies to enable spectrum flexibility and agility;

(F) optical and quantum communications technologies;

(G) security of advanced communications systems;

(H) public safety communications;

(I) resilient internet of things applications for advanced manufacturing; and

(J) other research areas determined necessary by the Director.

#### (3) Testbeds ####

In coordination with the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information, the private sector, and other Federal agencies as appropriate, the Director may develop and manage testbeds for research and development of advanced communications technologies, avoiding duplication of existing testbeds run by other agencies or the private sector.

#### (4) Outreach ####

In carrying out the activities under this subsection, the Director shall seek input from other Federal agencies and from private sector stakeholders, on an ongoing basis, to help inform research and development priorities, including through workshops and other multistakeholder activities.

#### (5) Technical roadmaps ####

In carrying out the activities under this subsection, the Director shall convene industry, institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, Federal laboratories, and other Federal agencies engaged in advanced communications research and development to develop, and periodically update, coordinated technical roadmaps for advanced communications research in priority areas, such as those described in paragraph (2).

#### (b) National Advanced Spectrum and Communications Test Network ####

#### (1) In general ####

The Director, in coordination with the Administrator of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and heads of other Federal agencies, as appropriate, shall operate a national network of government, academic, and commercial test capabilities and facilities to be known as the National Advanced Spectrum and Communications Test Network (referred to in this section as "NASCTN").

#### (2) Purposes ####

NASCTN shall be for the purposes of facilitating and coordinating the use of intellectual capacity, modeling and simulation, laboratory facilities, and test facilities to meet national spectrum interests and challenges, including—

(A) measurements and analyses of electromagnetic propagation, radio systems characteristics, and operating techniques affecting the utilization of the electromagnetic spectrum in coordination with specialized, related research and analysis performed by other Federal agencies in their areas of responsibility;

(B) conducting research and analysis in the general field of telecommunications sciences in support of the Institute's mission and in support of other Government agencies;

(C) developing methodologies for testing, measuring, and setting guidelines for interference;

(D) conducting interference tests to better understand the impact of current and proposed Federal and commercial spectrum activities;

(E) conducting research and testing to improve spectrum interference tolerance, flexibility, agility, and interference mitigation methods; and

(F) other activities as determined necessary by the Director.
