### §5924. Agricultural Genome to Phenome Initiative ###

#### (a) Goals ####

The goals of this section are—

(1) to expand knowledge concerning genomes and phenomes of crops and animals of importance to the agriculture sector of the United States;

(2) to understand how variable weather, environments, and production systems impact the growth and productivity of specific varieties of crops and species of animals in order to provide greater accuracy in predicting crop and animal performance under variable conditions;

(3) to support research that leverages plant and animal genomic information with phenotypic and environmental data through an interdisciplinary framework, leading to a novel understanding of plant and animal processes that affect growth, productivity, and the ability to predict performance, which will result in the deployment of superior varieties and species to producers and improved crop and animal management recommendations for farmers and ranchers;

(4) to catalyze and coordinate research that links genomics and predictive phenomics at different sites across the United States to achieve advances in crops and animals that generate societal benefits;

(5) to combine fields such as genetics, genomics, plant physiology, agronomy, climatology, and crop modeling with computation and informatics, statistics, and engineering;

(6) to combine fields such as genetics, genomics, animal physiology, meat science, animal nutrition, and veterinary science with computation and informatics, statistics, and engineering;

(7) to focus on crops and animals that will yield scientifically important results that will enhance the usefulness of many other crops and animals;

(8) to build on genomic research, such as the Plant Genome Research Project and the National Animal Genome Research Program, to understand gene function in production environments that is expected to have considerable returns for crops and animals of importance to the agriculture of the United States;

(9) to develop improved data analytics to enhance understanding of the biological function of genes;

(10) to allow resources developed under this section, including data, software, germplasm, and other biological materials, to be openly accessible to all persons, subject to any confidentiality requirements imposed by law; and

(11) to encourage international partnerships with each partner country responsible for financing its own research.

#### (b) Duties of Secretary ####

The Secretary of Agriculture (referred to in this section as the "Secretary") shall conduct a research initiative, to be known as the "Agricultural Genome to Phenome Initiative", for the purpose of—

(1) studying agriculturally significant crops and animals in production environments to achieve sustainable and secure agricultural production;

(2) ensuring that current gaps in existing knowledge of agricultural crop and animal genetics and phenomics are filled;

(3) identifying and developing a functional understanding of relevant genes from animals and agronomically relevant genes from crops that are of importance to the agriculture sector of the United States;

(4) ensuring future genetic improvement of crops and animals of importance to the agriculture sector of the United States;

(5) studying the relevance of diverse germplasm as a source of unique genes that may be of importance in the future;

(6) enhancing genetics to reduce the economic impact of pathogens on crops and animals of importance to the agriculture sector of the United States;

(7) disseminating findings to relevant audiences; and

(8) otherwise carrying out this section.

#### (c) Grants and cooperative agreements ####

#### (1) Authority ####

The Secretary, acting through the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, may make grants or enter into cooperative agreements with individuals and organizations in accordance with section 3318 of this title.

#### (2) Competitive basis ####

A grant or cooperative agreement under this subsection shall be made or entered into on a competitive basis.

#### (3) Consortia ####

The Secretary shall encourage awards under this section to consortia of eligible entities.

#### (d) Administration ####

Paragraphs (4), (7), (8), and (11)(B) of subsection (b) of section 3157 of this title shall apply with respect to the making of a grant or cooperative agreement under this section.

#### (e) Consultation with National Academy of Sciences ####

The Secretary may use funds made available under this section to consult with the National Academy of Sciences regarding the administration of the Agricultural Genome to Phenome Initiative.

#### (f) Matching funds requirement ####

#### (1) In general ####

Subject to paragraph (3), with respect to a grant or cooperative agreement under this section that provides a particular benefit to a specific agricultural commodity, the recipient of funds under the grant or cooperative agreement shall provide non-Federal matching funds (including funds from an agricultural commodity promotion, research, and information program) equal to not less than the amount provided under the grant or cooperative agreement.

#### (2) In-kind support ####

Non-Federal matching funds described in paragraph (1) may include in-kind support.

#### (3) Waiver ####

The Secretary may waive the matching funds requirement under paragraph (1) with respect to a research project if the Secretary determines that—

(A) the results of the project are of a particular benefit to a specific agricultural commodity, but those results are likely to be applicable to agricultural commodities generally; or

(B)(i) the project—

(I) involves a minor commodity; and

(II) deals with scientifically important research; and

(ii) the recipient is unable to satisfy the matching funds requirement.

#### (g) Authorization of appropriations ####

There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section $40,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2019 through 2023.
