#### References in Text ####

Section 1703(a) of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, referred to in subsec. (b)(1), probably means section 1603 of Pub. L. 110–246, because Pub. L. 110–246 does not contain a section 1703 and subsec. (b)(3) of section 1603 of Pub. L. 110–246 amended section 1308 of this title by striking out provisions relating to issuance of regulations defining “person”.

The Disaster Assistance Act of 1988, referred to in subsecs. (c) and (d), is Pub. L. 100–387, Aug. 11, 1988, 102 Stat. 924. Section 211(c) of that act is set out as a note under section 1421 of this title. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title of 1988 Amendment note set out under section 1421 of this title and Tables.
