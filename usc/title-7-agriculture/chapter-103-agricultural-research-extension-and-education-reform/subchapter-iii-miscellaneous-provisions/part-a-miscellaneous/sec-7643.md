#### Codification ####

Section was formerly classified to section 417 of this title prior to editorial reclassification and renumbering as this section.

Section was enacted as part of act June 30, 1906, ch. 3913, and not as part of the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998, which in part comprises this chapter.

Section is derived from an Appropriation Act for the Department of Agriculture, 1907. The last proviso of section relating to farmers' bulletins not called for in quotas of Senators and Representatives was omitted from the Code as obsolete in view of Attorney General's opinion, 27 Op. Atty. Gen. 288.
