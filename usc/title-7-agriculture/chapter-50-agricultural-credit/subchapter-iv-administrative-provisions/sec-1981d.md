#### Amendments ####

**2018**—Subsec. (e). Pub. L. 115–334 inserted "or, in extraordinary circumstances as determined by the applicable State director, after the 60-day period" after "within 60 days after receipt of the notice required in this section".

**1996**—Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 104–127 substituted "90 days past due on" for "180 days delinquent in".

L. 102–554, which directed the insertion of "or, in extraordinary circumstances as determined by the applicable State director, after the 60-day period" after "not later than 60 days after receipt of the notice required in this section", could not be executed because the phrase "not later than 60 days after receipt of the notice required in this section" did not appear in text.
