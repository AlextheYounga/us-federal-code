#### **Editorial Notes** ####

#### References in Text ####

The Delta Development Act, referred to in par. (2), is S. 2836 of the 100th Congress, as introduced on Sept. 27, 1988, and incorporated by reference by, and made a part of, Pub. L. 100–460, title II, Oct. 1, 1988, 102 Stat. 2246, as amended. Section 4 of the Delta Development Act, which was set out in a note under section 3121 of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare, was omitted from the Code. See Lower Mississippi Delta Development Commission note under section 3121 of Title 42 and Tables.

#### Amendments ####

**2018**—Par. (4). Pub. L. 115–334 added par. (4).

**2000**—Par. (4). Pub. L. 106–554, §1(a)(4) [div. B, title I, §153(b)], which directed amendment of "section 382A of 'The Delta Regional Authority Act of 2000' as incorporated in this Act" by adding par. (4), could not be executed as directed because this section is not section 382A of such Act, but rather section 382A of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act, as added by section 503 of the Delta Regional Authority Act of 2000. Corrected amendment was made by Pub. L. 115–334, effective as if included in Pub. L. 106–554. See 2018 Amendment note above and 2018 Effective Date of 2018 Amendment note below.

#### Findings and Purposes ####

Pub. L. 106–554, §1(a)(4) [div. B, title V, §502], Dec. 21, 2000, 114 Stat. 2763, 2763A–268, provided that:

"(a) Findings.—Congress finds that—

"(1) the lower Mississippi River region (referred to in this title [enacting this subchapter and amending provisions classified as a note under section 3121 of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare] as the 'region'), though rich in natural and human resources, lags behind the rest of the United States in economic growth and prosperity;

"(2) the region suffers from a greater proportion of measurable poverty and unemployment than any other region of the United States;

"(3) the greatest hope for economic growth and revitalization in the region lies in the development of transportation infrastructure, creation of jobs, expansion of businesses, and development of entrepreneurial local economies;

"(4) the economic progress of the region requires an adequate transportation and physical infrastructure, a skilled and trained workforce, and greater opportunities for enterprise development and entrepreneurship;

"(5) a concerted and coordinated effort among Federal, State, and local agencies, the private sector, and nonprofit groups is needed if the region is to achieve its full potential for economic development;

"(6) economic development planning on a regional or multicounty basis offers the best prospect for achieving the maximum benefit from public and private investments; and

"(7) improving the economy of the region requires a special emphasis on areas of the region that are most economically distressed.

"(b) Purposes.—The purposes of this title are—

"(1) to promote and encourage the economic development of the region—

"(A) to ensure that the communities and people in the region have the opportunity for economic development; and

"(B) to ensure that the economy of the region reaches economic parity with that of the rest of the United States;

"(2) to establish a formal framework for joint Federal-State collaboration in meeting and focusing national attention on the economic development needs of the region;

"(3) to assist the region in obtaining the transportation and basic infrastructure, skills training, and opportunities for economic development that are essential for strong local economies;

"(4) to foster coordination among all levels of government, the private sector, and nonprofit groups in crafting common regional strategies that will lead to broader economic growth;

"(5) to strengthen efforts that emphasize regional approaches to economic development and planning;

"(6) to encourage the participation of interested citizens, public officials, agencies, and others in developing and implementing local and regional plans for broad-based economic and community development; and

"(7) to focus special attention on areas of the region that suffer from the greatest economic distress."
