#### References in Text ####

Section 1308 of this title (before the amendment made by section 1703(a) of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008), referred to in subsec. (c)(1), probably means section 1308 of this title before the amendment made by section 1603(b)(3)(A) of Pub. L. 110–246, which struck out provisions in section 1308 of this title relating to issuance of regulations defining the term “person”. The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 does not contain a section 1703.
