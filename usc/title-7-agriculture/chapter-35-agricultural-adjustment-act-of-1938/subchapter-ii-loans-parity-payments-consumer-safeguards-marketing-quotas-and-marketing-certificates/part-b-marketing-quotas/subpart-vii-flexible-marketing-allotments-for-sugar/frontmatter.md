Part VII of subtitle B of title III of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, comprising this subpart, was originally added to act Feb. 16, 1938, ch. 30, title III, by Pub. L. 101–624, title IX, §902, Nov. 28, 1990, 104 Stat. 3479, and amended Pub. L. 102–237, title I, §111(c)–(k), Dec. 13, 1991, 105 Stat. 1830–1836; Pub. L. 102–535, Oct. 27, 1992, 106 Stat. 3526; Pub. L. 103–66, title I, §1107(b), Aug. 10, 1993, 107 Stat. 324. Part VII is shown herein, however, as having been added by Pub. L. 107–171, title I, §1403, May 13, 2002, 116 Stat. 187, without reference to those intervening amendments because of the extensive revision of part VII by Pub. L. 107–171.
