(2) such suspension or restriction of the export of such agricultural commodity is imposed other than in connection with a suspension or restriction of all exports from the United States to such country or area of the world; and

(3) sales of such agricultural commodity for export from the United States to such country or area of the world during the year preceding the year in which the suspension or restriction is imposed exceeds 3 percent of the total sales of such commodity for export from the United States to all foreign countries during the year preceding the year in which the suspension or restriction is in effect;

the Secretary shall compensate producers of the commodity involved by making payments available to such producers, as provided in subsection (b) of this section.

#### (b) Amount of payments ####

If the Secretary makes payments available to producers under subsection (a), the amount of such payment shall be determined—

(1) in the case of an agricultural commodity for which payments are authorized to be made to producers under Title I of the Agricultural Act of 1949 (7 U.S.C. 1441 et seq.), by multiplying—

(A) the farm program payment yield for the producer or the yield established for the farm for the commodity involved; by

#### (c) Time for payments ####

Payments under paragraph (1) of subsection (b) shall be made for each marketing year or part thereof during which the suspension or restriction is in effect and shall be made in equal amounts at 90-day intervals, beginning 90 days after the date of the imposition of the suspension or restriction.
