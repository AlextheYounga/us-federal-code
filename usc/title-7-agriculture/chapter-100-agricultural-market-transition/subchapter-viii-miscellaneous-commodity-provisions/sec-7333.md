#### (B) Ineligibility for benefits ####

#### (i) In general ####

Subject to clause (ii) and subparagraph (C), native sod acreage that has been tilled for the production of an annual crop after the date of enactment of this paragraph shall be ineligible during the first 5 crop years of planting, as determined by the Secretary, for benefits under—

(I) this section; and

(II) the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.).

#### (ii) De minimis acreage exemption ####

The Secretary shall exempt areas of 5 acres or less from clause (i).

#### (C) Application ####

Subparagraph (B) may apply to native sod acreage in the Prairie Pothole National Priority Area at the election of the Governor of the respective State.

#### (2) Records ####

To be eligible for assistance under this section, a producer shall provide annually to the Secretary records of crop acreage, acreage yields, and production for each crop, as required by the Secretary.

#### (3) Acreage reports ####

A producer shall provide annual reports on acreage planted or prevented from being planted, as required by the Secretary, by the designated acreage reporting date for the crop and location as established by the Secretary.

#### (c) Loss requirements ####

#### (1) Cause ####

To be eligible for assistance under this section, a producer of an eligible crop shall have suffered a loss of a noninsured commodity as the result of a cause described in subsection (a)(3) of this section.

#### (2) Assistance ####

On making a determination described in subsection (a)(3) for aquaculture producers, the Secretary shall provide assistance under this section to aquaculture producers from all losses related to drought.

#### (3) Prevented planting ####

Subject to paragraph (1), the Secretary shall make a prevented planting noninsured crop disaster assistance payment if the producer is prevented from planting more than 35 percent of the acreage intended for the eligible crop because of drought, flood, or other natural disaster, as determined by the Secretary.

#### (4) Area trigger ####

The Secretary shall provide assistance to individual producers without any requirement of an area loss.

#### (d) Payment ####

The Secretary shall make available to a producer eligible for noninsured assistance under this section a payment computed by multiplying—

(1) the quantity that is less than 50 percent of the established yield for the crop; by

(2)(A) in the case of each of the 1996 through 1998 crop years, 60 percent of the average market price for the crop (or any comparable coverage determined by the Secretary); or

(B) in the case of each of the 1999 and subsequent crop years, 55 percent of the average market price for the crop (or any comparable coverage determined by the Secretary); by

(3) a payment rate for the type of crop (as determined by the Secretary) that—

(A) in the case of a crop that is produced with a significant and variable harvesting expense, reflects the decreasing cost incurred in the production cycle for the crop that is—

(i) harvested;

(ii) planted but not harvested; and

(iii) prevented from being planted because of drought, flood, or other natural disaster (as determined by the Secretary); and

(B) in the case of a crop that is not produced with a significant and variable harvesting expense, as determined by the Secretary.

#### (e) Yield determinations ####

#### (1) Establishment ####

The Secretary shall establish farm yields for purposes of providing noninsured crop disaster assistance under this section.

#### (2) Actual production history ####

The Secretary shall determine yield coverage using the actual production history of the producer over a period of not less than the 4 previous consecutive crop years and not more than 10 consecutive crop years. Subject to paragraph (3), the yield for the year in which noninsured crop disaster assistance is sought shall be equal to the average of the actual production history of the producer during the period considered.

#### (3) Assignment of yield ####

If a producer does not submit adequate documentation of production history to determine a crop yield under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall assign to the producer a yield equal to not less than 65 percent of the transitional yield of the producer (adjusted to reflect actual production reflected in the records acceptable to the Secretary for continuous years), as specified in regulations issued by the Secretary based on production history requirements.

#### (4) Prohibition on assigned yields in certain counties ####

#### (A) In general ####

#### (i) Documentation ####

If sufficient data are available to demonstrate that the acreage of a crop in a county for the crop year has increased by more than 100 percent over any year in the preceding 7 crop years or, if data are not available, if the acreage of the crop in the county has increased significantly from the previous crop years, a producer must provide such detailed documentation of production costs, acres planted, and yield for the crop year for which benefits are being claimed as is required by the Secretary. If the Secretary determines that the documentation provided is not sufficient, the Secretary may require documenting proof that the crop, had the crop been harvested, could have been marketed at a reasonable price.

#### (ii) Prohibition ####

Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a producer who produces a crop on a farm located in a county described in clause (i) may not obtain an assigned yield.

(ii)(I) the County Executive Director and the State Executive Director recommend an exemption from the requirement to the Administrator of the Agency; and

(II) the Administrator approves the recommendation.

#### (5) Limitation on receipt of subsequent assigned yield ####

#### (6) Yield variations due to different farming practices ####

The Secretary shall ensure that noninsured crop disaster assistance accurately reflects significant yield variations due to different farming practices, such as between irrigated and nonirrigated acreage.

#### (f) Contract payments ####

A producer who has received a guaranteed payment for production, as opposed to delivery, of a crop pursuant to a contract shall have the production of the producer adjusted upward by the amount of the production equal to the amount of the contract payment received.

#### (g) Use of Commodity Credit Corporation ####

The Secretary may use the funds of the Commodity Credit Corporation to carry out this section.

#### (h) Exclusions ####

Noninsured crop disaster assistance under this section shall not cover losses due to—

(1) the neglect or malfeasance of the producer;
