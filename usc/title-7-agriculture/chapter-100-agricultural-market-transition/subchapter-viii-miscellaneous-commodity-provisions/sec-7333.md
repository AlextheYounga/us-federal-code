#### (1) In general ####

#### (A) Coverages ####

In the case of an eligible crop described in paragraph (2), the Secretary of Agriculture shall operate a noninsured crop disaster assistance program to provide coverages based on individual yields (other than for value-loss crops) equivalent to—

(i) catastrophic risk protection available under section 508(b) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1508(b)); or

(ii) except in the case of crops and grasses used for grazing, additional coverage available under subsections (c) and (h) of section 508 of that Act (7 U.S.C. 1508) that does not exceed 65 percent, as described in subsection (l).

#### (B) Administration ####

The Secretary shall carry out this section through the Farm Service Agency (referred to in this section as the "Agency").

#### (C) Data collection and sharing ####

The Secretary shall coordinate with the Administrator of the Risk Management Agency on the type and format of data received under the noninsured crop disaster assistance program that—

(i) best facilitates the use of that data in developing policies or plans of insurance offered under the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.); and

(ii) ensures the availability of that data on a regular basis.

#### (D) Coordination ####

The Secretary shall coordinate between the agencies of the Department that provide programs or services to farmers and ranchers that are potentially eligible for the noninsured crop disaster assistance program under this section—

(i) to make available coverage under—

(I) the fee waiver under subsection (k)(2); or

(II) the premium discount under subsection (l)(3); and

(ii) to share eligibility information to reduce paperwork and avoid duplication.

#### (2) Eligible crops ####

#### (A) In general ####

Subject to subparagraph (B), in this section, the term "eligible crop" means each commercial crop or other agricultural commodity that is produced for food or fiber (except livestock) for which catastrophic risk protection under subsection (b) of section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1508) and additional coverage under subsections (c) and (h) of such section are not available or, if such coverage is available, it is only available under a policy that provides coverage for specific intervals based on weather indexes or under a whole farm plan of insurance.

#### (B) Crops specifically included ####

The term "eligible crop" shall include floricultural, ornamental nursery, and Christmas tree crops, turfgrass sod, seed crops, aquaculture (including ornamental fish), sea grass and sea oats, camelina, sweet sorghum, biomass sorghum, and industrial crops (including those grown expressly for the purpose of producing a feedstock for renewable biofuel, renewable electricity, or biobased products).

#### (C) Combination of similar types or varieties ####

At the option of the Secretary, all types or varieties of a crop or commodity, described in subparagraphs (A) and (B), may be considered to be a single eligible crop under this section.

#### (3) Cause of loss ####

To qualify for assistance under this section, the losses of the noninsured commodity shall be due to drought, flood, or other natural disaster, as determined by the Secretary.

#### (4) Program reduction in benefits relating to crop production on native sod ####

#### (A) Definition of native sod ####

In this paragraph, the term "native sod" means land—

(i) on which the plant cover is composed principally of native grasses, grasslike plants, forbs, or shrubs suitable for grazing and browsing; and

(ii) that has never been tilled, or the producer cannot substantiate that the ground has ever been tilled, for the production of an annual crop as of the date of enactment of this paragraph.

#### (B) Reduction in benefits ####

#### (i) In general ####

#### (I) Agricultural Act of 2014 ####

During the first 4 crop years of planting, as determined by the Secretary, native sod acreage that has been tilled for the production of an annual crop during the period beginning on February 8, 2014, and ending on December 20, 2018, shall be subject to a reduction in benefits under this section as described in this subparagraph.

#### (II) Subsequent years ####

Native sod acreage that has been tilled for the production of an eligible crop after December 20, 2018, shall be subject to a reduction in benefits under this section as described in this subparagraph for not more than any 4 crop years—

(aa) during the first 10 crop years after the initial tillage; and

(bb) during which a crop on that acreage is enrolled under subsection (l)(2) or (k).

(B) in the case of a crop that is not produced with a significant and variable harvesting expense, as determined by the Secretary.

#### (e) Yield determinations ####

#### (1) Establishment ####

The Secretary shall establish approved yields for purposes of providing noninsured crop disaster assistance under this section.

#### (2) Actual production history ####

#### (A) In general ####

The Secretary shall determine an approved yield using the actual production history of the producer over a period of not less than the 4 previous consecutive crop years and not more than 10 consecutive crop years.

#### (B) Calculation ####

Subject to paragraph (3), the approved yield for the year in which noninsured crop disaster assistance is sought shall be equal to the average of the actual production history of the producer during the period considered.

#### (3) Assignment of yield ####

If a producer does not submit adequate documentation of production history to determine a crop yield under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall assign to the producer a yield equal to not less than 65 percent of the county expected yield (adjusted to reflect actual production reflected in the records acceptable to the Secretary for continuous years), as specified in regulations issued by the Secretary based on production history requirements.

#### (4) Prohibition on assigned yields in certain counties ####

#### (A) In general ####

#### (i) Documentation ####

If sufficient data are available to demonstrate that the acreage of a crop in a county for the crop year has increased by more than 100 percent over any year in the preceding 7 crop years or, if data are not available, if the acreage of the crop in the county has increased significantly from the previous crop years, a producer must provide such detailed documentation of production costs, acres planted, and yield for the crop year for which benefits are being claimed as is required by the Secretary. If the Secretary determines that the documentation provided is not sufficient, the Secretary may require documenting proof that the crop, had the crop been harvested, could have been marketed at a reasonable price.

#### (ii) Prohibition ####

Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a producer who produces a crop on a farm located in a county described in clause (i) may not obtain an assigned yield.

#### (6) Yield variations due to different farming practices ####

The Secretary shall ensure that noninsured crop disaster assistance accurately reflects significant yield variations due to different farming practices, such as between irrigated and nonirrigated acreage.

#### (g) Use of Commodity Credit Corporation ####

The Secretary may use the funds of the Commodity Credit Corporation to carry out this section.

#### (h) Exclusions ####

Noninsured crop disaster assistance under this section shall not cover losses due to—
