For the 2014 through 2018 crop years (except as provided in subsection (g)) and for the 2019 through 2023 crop years (subject to subsection (h)), all of the producers on a farm shall make a 1-time, irrevocable election to obtain—

(2) individual coverage applicable to all of the covered commodities on the farm.

#### (c) Effect of failure to make unanimous election ####

If all the producers on a farm fail to make a unanimous election under subsection (a) for the 2014 crop year or the 2019 crop year, as applicable—

If all the producers on a farm select county coverage for a covered commodity under subsection (b)(1), the Secretary may not make price loss coverage payments under section 9016 of this title to the producers on the farm with respect to that covered commodity.

#### (e) Effect of selection of individual coverage ####

If all the producers on a farm select individual coverage under subsection (b)(2), in addition to the selection and election under this section applying to each producer on the farm, the Secretary shall consider, for purposes of making the calculations required by subsections (b)(2) and (c)(3) of section 9017 of this title, the producer's share of all farms in the same State—

#### (1) In general ####

In the case of acres allocated to seed cotton on a farm, for the 2018 crop year, all of the producers on the farm shall be given the opportunity to make a new 1-time election under subsection (a) to reflect the designation of seed cotton as a covered commodity for that crop year under section 9011(6)(B) of this title.

#### (2) Effect of failure to make unanimous election ####

For the 2021 crop year and each crop year thereafter, all of the producers on a farm may change the election under subsection (a), subsection (c), or this subsection, as applicable, to price loss coverage or agriculture risk coverage, as applicable.
