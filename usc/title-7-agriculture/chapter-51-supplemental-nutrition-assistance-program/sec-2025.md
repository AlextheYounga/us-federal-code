The officials responsible for making determinations of ineligibility under this chapter shall not receive or benefit from revenues retained by the State under the provisions of this subsection.

#### (b) Work supplementation or support program ####

#### (1) “Work supplementation or support program” defined ####

In this subsection, the term “work supplementation or support program” means a program under which, as determined by the Secretary, public assistance (including any benefits provided under a program established by the State and the supplemental nutrition assistance program) is provided to an employer to be used for hiring and employing a public assistance recipient who was not employed by the employer at the time the public assistance recipient entered the program.

#### (2) Program ####

A State agency may elect to use an amount equal to the allotment that would otherwise be issued to a household under the supplemental nutrition assistance program, but for the operation of this subsection, for the purpose of subsidizing or supporting a job under a work supplementation or support program established by the State.

#### (3) Procedure ####

If a State agency makes an election under paragraph (2) and identifies each household that participates in the supplemental nutrition assistance program that contains an individual who is participating in the work supplementation or support program—

(A) the Secretary shall pay to the State agency an amount equal to the value of the allotment that the household would be eligible to receive but for the operation of this subsection;

A State agency shall provide a description of how the public assistance recipients in the program shall, within a specific period of time, be moved from supplemented or supported employment to employment that is not supplemented or supported.

#### (6) Displacement ####

A work supplementation or support program shall not displace the employment of individuals who are not supplemented or supported.

#### (c) Quality control system ####

#### (1) In general ####

#### (A) System ####

In carrying out the supplemental nutrition assistance program, the Secretary shall carry out a system that enhances payment accuracy and improves administration by establishing fiscal incentives that require State agencies with high payment error rates to share in the cost of payment error.

#### (B) Adjustment of Federal share of administrative costs for fiscal years before fiscal year 2003 ####

#### (i) In general ####

Subject to clause (ii), with respect to any fiscal year before fiscal year 2003, the Secretary shall adjust a State agency's federally funded share of administrative costs under subsection (a) of this section, other than the costs already shared in excess of 50 percent under the proviso in the first sentence of subsection (a) of this section or under subsection (g) of this section, by increasing that share of all such administrative costs by 1 percentage point to a maximum of 60 percent of all such administrative costs for each full 1/10 of a percentage point by which the payment error rate is less than 6 percent.

#### (ii) Limitation ####

Only States with a rate of invalid decisions in denying eligibility that is less than a nationwide percentage that the Secretary determines to be reasonable shall be entitled to the adjustment under clause (i).

#### (C) Establishment of liability amount for fiscal year 2003 and thereafter ####

With respect to fiscal year 2004 and any fiscal year thereafter for which the Secretary determines that, for the second or subsequent consecutive fiscal year, a 95 percent statistical probability exists that the payment error rate of a State agency exceeds 105 percent of the national performance measure for payment error rates announced under paragraph (6), the Secretary shall establish an amount for which the State agency may be liable (referred to in this paragraph as the “liability amount”) that is equal to the product obtained by multiplying—

(i) the value of all allotments issued by the State agency in the fiscal year;

(ii) the difference between—

(I) the payment error rate of the State agency; and

(II) 6 percent; and

(iii) 10 percent.

#### (D) Authority of Secretary with respect to liability amount ####

With respect to the liability amount established for a State agency under subparagraph (C) for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall—

(i)(I) waive the responsibility of the State agency to pay all or any portion of the liability amount established for the fiscal year (referred to in this paragraph as the “waiver amount”);

(II) require that a portion, not to exceed 50 percent, of the liability amount established for the fiscal year be used by the State agency for new investment, approved by the Secretary, to improve administration by the State agency of the supplemental nutrition assistance program (referred to in this paragraph as the “new investment amount”), which new investment amount shall not be matched by Federal funds;

(III) designate a portion, not to exceed 50 percent, of the amount established for the fiscal year for payment to the Secretary in accordance with subparagraph (E) (referred to in this paragraph as the “at-risk amount”); or

#### (i) In general ####

A State agency shall pay to the Secretary the at-risk amount designated under subparagraph (D)(i)(III) for any fiscal year in accordance with clause (ii), if, with respect to the immediately following fiscal year, a liability amount has been established for the State agency under subparagraph (C).

#### (ii) Method of payment of at-risk amount ####

#### (I) Remission to the Secretary ####

#### (II) Alternative method of collection ####

#### (aa) In general ####

If the chief executive officer of the State fails to make the payment under subclause (I) within a reasonable period of time determined by the Secretary, the Secretary may reduce any amount due to the State agency under any other provision of this section by the amount required to be paid under clause (i).

#### (ii) Effect of State agency's wholly prevailing on appeal ####

If a State agency begins required new investment under subparagraph (D)(i)(II), the State agency appeals the liability amount of the State agency, and the determination by the Secretary of the liability amount is reduced to $0 on administrative or judicial review, the Secretary shall pay to the State agency an amount equal to 50 percent of the new investment amount that was included in the liability amount subject to the appeal.

#### (iii) Effect of Secretary's wholly prevailing on appeal ####

If a State agency does not begin required new investment under subparagraph (D)(i)(II), the State agency appeals the liability amount of the State agency, and the determination by the Secretary of the liability amount is wholly upheld on administrative or judicial review, the Secretary shall—

(I) require all or any portion of the new investment amount to be used by the State agency for new investment, approved by the Secretary, to improve administration by the State agency of the supplemental nutrition assistance program, which amount shall not be matched by Federal funds; and

(II) require payment of any remaining portion of the new investment amount in accordance with subparagraph (E)(ii).
