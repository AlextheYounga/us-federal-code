### §2011. Congressional declaration of policy ###

It is declared to be the policy of Congress, in order to promote the general welfare, to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation's population by raising levels of nutrition among low-income households. Congress finds that the limited food purchasing power of low-income households contributes to hunger and malnutrition among members of such households. Congress further finds that increased utilization of food in establishing and maintaining adequate national levels of nutrition will promote the distribution in a beneficial manner of the Nation's agricultural abundance and will strengthen the Nation's agricultural economy, as well as result in more orderly marketing and distribution of foods. To alleviate such hunger and malnutrition, a supplemental nutrition assistance program is herein authorized which will permit low-income households to obtain a more nutritious diet through normal channels of trade by increasing food purchasing power for all eligible households who apply for participation.

That program includes as a purpose to assist low-income adults in obtaining employment and increasing their earnings. Such employment and earnings, along with program benefits, will permit low-income households to obtain a more nutritious diet through normal channels of trade by increasing food purchasing power for all eligible households who apply for participation.

"(2) Qualifications.—The members of the Committee shall be individuals who are familiar with the rules, goals, and limitations of Federal supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits, cash, medical, and housing assistance programs for low-income families and individuals, and may include individuals who have demonstrated expertise in evaluating the operations of and interaction among such programs as they affect administrators and recipients, persons who have experience in administering such programs at the Federal, State, or local level, and representatives of administrators and recipients affected by such programs.

"(b) Purpose.—It shall be the purpose of the Committee, in consultation, where appropriate, with program administrators and representatives of recipients—

"(1) to identify the significant policies implemented in the supplemental nutrition assistance program, cash and medical assistance programs under the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.], and housing assistance programs (whether resulting from law, regulations, or administrative practice) that, because they differ substantially, make it difficult for those eligible to apply for and obtain benefits from more than one program and restrict the ability of administrators of such programs to provide efficient, timely, and appropriate benefits to those eligible for more than one type of assistance, drawing, where appropriate, on previous efforts to coordinate and simplify such programs and policies;

"(2) to examine the major reasons for such different programs and policies;

"(3) to evaluate how and the extent to which such different programs and policies hinder, to a significant degree, the receipt of benefits from more than one program and substantially restrict administrators' ability to provide efficient, timely, and appropriate benefits;

"(4) to recommend common or simplified programs and policies (including recommendations for changes in law, regulations, and administrative practice and for policies that do not currently exist in such programs) that would substantially reduce difficulties in applying for and obtaining benefits from more than one program and significantly increase the ability of administrators of such programs to efficiently provide timely and appropriate assistance to those eligible for more than one type of assistance; and

"(5) to describe the major effects of such common or simplified programs and policies (including how such common or simplified programs and policies would enhance or conflict with the purposes of such programs, how they would ease burdens on administrators and recipients, how they would affect program costs and participation, and the degree to which they would change the relationships between the Federal Government and the States in such programs) and the reasons for recommending such programs and policies (including reasons, if any, that might be sufficient to override special rules derived from the purposes of individual programs).

"(c) Administrative Support.—The Secretary shall provide the Committee with such technical and other assistance, including secretarial and clerical assistance, as may be required to carry out its functions.

"(d) Reimbursement.—Members of the Committee shall serve without compensation but shall receive reimbursement for necessary travel and subsistence expenses incurred by such members in the performance of the duties of the Committee.

"(e) Reports.—Not later than July 1, 1993, the Committee shall prepare and submit, to the appropriate committees of Congress, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development a final report, including recommendations for common or simplified programs and policies and the effects of and reasons for such programs and policies and may submit interim reports, including reports on common or simplified programs and policies covering less than the complete range of programs and policies under review, to the committees and such Secretaries as deemed appropriate by the Committee."
