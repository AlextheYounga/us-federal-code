### §2349cc. Findings ###

Congress makes the following findings:

(1) Increasingly digitized and interconnected social, political, and economic systems have introduced new vulnerabilities for malicious actors to exploit, which threatens economic and national security.

(2) The rapid development, deployment, and integration of information and communication technologies into all aspects of modern life bring mounting risks of accidents and malicious activity involving such technologies, and their potential consequences.

(3) Because information and communication technologies are globally manufactured, traded, and networked, the economic and national security of the United State <sup><a href="#2349cc_1_target" name="2349cc_1">1</a></sup> depends greatly on cybersecurity practices of other actors, including other countries.

(4) United States assistance to countries and international organizations to bolster civilian capacity to address national cybersecurity and deterrence in cyberspace can help—

(A) reduce vulnerability in the information and communication technologies ecosystem; and

(B) advance national and economic security objectives.
