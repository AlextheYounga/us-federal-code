### §2373. Eastern Mediterranean policy requirements ###

#### (a) Congressional declaration and statement of findings ####

The Congress declares that the achievement of a just and lasting Cyprus settlement is and will remain a central objective of United States foreign policy. The Congress further declares that any action of the United States with respect to section 2370(x) <sup><a href="#2373_1_target" name="2373_1">1</a></sup> of this title shall not signify a lessening of the United States commitment to a just solution to the conflict on Cyprus but is authorized in the expectation that this action will be conducive to achievement of a Cyprus solution and a general improvement in relations among Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus and between those countries and the United States. The Congress finds that—

(1) a just settlement on Cyprus must involve the establishment of a free and independent government on Cyprus and must guarantee that the human rights of all of the people of Cyprus are fully protected;

(2) a just settlement on Cyprus must include the withdrawal of Turkish military forces from Cyprus;

(3) the guidelines for inter-communal talks agreed to in Nicosia in February 1977 and the United Nations resolutions regarding Cyprus provide a sound basis for negotiation of a just settlement on Cyprus;

(4) serious negotiations, under United Nations auspices, will be necessary to achieve agreement on, and implementation of, constitutional and territorial terms within such guidelines; and

(5) the recent proposals by both Cypriot communities regarding the return of the refugees to the city of New Famagusta (Varosha) constitute a positive step and the United States should actively support the efforts of the Secretary General of the United Nations with respect to this issue.

#### (b) Governing principles ####

United States policy regarding Cyprus, Greece, and Turkey shall be directed toward the restoration of a stable and peaceful atmosphere in the Eastern Mediterranean region and shall therefore be governed by the following principles:

(1) The United States shall actively support the resolution of differences through negotiations and internationally established peaceful procedures, shall encourage all parties to avoid provocative actions, and shall strongly oppose any attempt to resolve disputes through force or threat of force.

(2) The United States will accord full support and high priority to efforts, particularly those of the United Nations, to bring about a prompt, peaceful settlement on Cyprus.

(3) All defense articles furnished by the United States to countries in the Eastern Mediterranean region will be used only in accordance with the requirements of this chapter, the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.], and the agreements under which those defense articles were furnished.

(4) The United States will furnish security assistance for Greece and Turkey only when furnishing that assistance is intended solely for defensive purposes, including when necessary to enable the recipient country to fulfill its responsibilities as a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and shall be designed to ensure that the present balance of military strength among countries of the region, including between Greece and Turkey, is preserved. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prohibit the transfer of defense articles to Greece or Turkey for legitimate self defense or to enable Greece or Turkey to fulfill their North Atlantic Treaty Organization obligations.

(5) The United States shall use its influence to ensure the continuation of the ceasefire on Cyprus until an equitable negotiated settlement is reached.

(6) The United States shall use its influence to achieve the withdrawal of Turkish military forces from Cyprus in the context of a solution to the Cyprus problem.

#### (c) Review of policy; report to Congress ####

Because progress toward a Cyprus settlement is a high priority of United States policy in the Eastern Mediterranean, the President and the Congress shall continually review that progress and shall determine United States policy in the region accordingly. To facilitate such a review the President shall, within 60 days after the date of enactment of this section and at the end of each succeeding 60-day period, transmit to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate a report on progress made toward the conclusion of a negotiated solution of the Cyprus problem. Such transmissions shall include any relevant reports prepared by the Secretary General of the United Nations for the Security Council.

#### (d) Certification by President to Congress of assistance to Greece and Turkey ####

In order to ensure that United States assistance is furnished consistent with the policies established in this section, the President shall, whenever requesting any funds for security assistance under this chapter or the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.] for Greece and Turkey, transmit to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate his certification, with a full explanation thereof, that the furnishing of such assistance will be consistent with the principles set forth in subsection (b). The President shall also submit such a certification with any notification to the Congress, pursuant to section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2776(b)], of a proposed sale of defense articles or services to Greece or Turkey.

#### (e) Arms sales agreements to prohibit transfer to Cyprus ####

(1) Except as provided in paragraph (3), any agreement for the sale or provision of any article on the United States Munitions List (established pursuant to section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2778]) entered into by the United States after December 22, 1987, shall expressly state that the article is being provided by the United States only with the understanding that it will not be transferred to Cyprus or otherwise used to further the severance or division of Cyprus.

(2) The President shall report to Congress any substantial evidence that equipment provided under any such agreement has been used in a manner inconsistent with the purposes of this subsection.

(3) The requirement under paragraph (1) shall not apply to any sale or other provision of any defense article or defense service to Cyprus if the end-user of such defense article or defense service is the Government of the Republic of Cyprus.

Pub. L. 116–94, div. J, title II, Dec. 20, 2019, 133 Stat. 3048, provided that:

#### "SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE. ####

"This title may be cited as the 'Eastern Mediterranean Security and Energy Partnership Act of 2019'.

#### "SEC. 202. FINDINGS. ####

"Congress makes the following findings:

"(1) The security of partners and allies in the Eastern Mediterranean region is critical to the security of the United States and Europe.

"(2) Greece is a valuable member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and a key pillar of stability in the Eastern Mediterranean.

"(3) Israel is a steadfast ally of the United States and has been designated a 'major non-NATO ally' and 'major strategic partner'.

"(4) Cyprus is a key strategic partner and signed a Statement of Intent with the United States on November 6, 2018, to enhance bilateral security cooperation.

"(5) The countries of Greece, Cyprus, and Israel have participated in critical trilateral summits to improve cooperation on energy and security issues.

"(6) Secretary of State Mike Pompeo participated in the trilateral summit among Israel, Greece, and Cyprus on March 20, 2019.

"(7) The United States, Israel, Greece, and Cyprus oppose any action in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Aegean Sea that could challenge stability, violate international law, or undermine good neighborly relations, and in a joint declaration on March 21, 2019, agreed to 'defend against external malign influences in the Eastern Mediterranean and the broader Middle East'.

"(8) The recent discovery of what may be the region's largest natural gas field off the Egyptian coast and the newest discoveries of natural gas off the coast of Cyprus could represent a significant and positive development for the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East, enhancing the region's strategic energy significance.

"(9) It is in the national security interest of the United States to promote, achieve, and maintain energy security among, and through cooperation with, allies.

"(10) Natural gas developments in the Eastern Mediterranean have the potential to provide economic gains and contribute to energy security in the region and Europe, as well as support European efforts to diversify away from natural gas supplied by the Russian Federation.

"(11) The soon to be completed Trans Adriatic Pipeline is a critical component of the Southern Gas Corridor and the European Union's efforts to diversify energy resources.

"(12) The proposed Eastern Mediterranean pipeline, if commercially viable, would provide for energy diversification in accordance with the European Union's third energy package of reforms.

"(13) The United States acknowledges the achievements and importance of the Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation (BIRD) and the United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF) and supports continued multiyear funding to ensure the continuity of the programs of the Foundations.

"(14) The United States has welcomed Greece's allocation of 2 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) to defense in accordance with commitments made at the 2014 NATO Summit in Wales.

"(15) Energy exploration in the Eastern Mediterranean region must be safeguarded against threats posed by terrorist and extremist groups, including Hezbollah and any other actor in the region.

"(16) The energy exploration in the Republic of Cyprus's Exclusive Economic Zone and territorial waters—

"(A) furthers United States interests by providing a potential alternative to Russian gas for United States allies and partners; and

"(B) should not be impeded by other sovereign states.

"(17) The United States Government cooperates closely with Cyprus, Greece, and Israel through information sharing agreements.

"(18) United States officials have assisted the Government of the Republic of Cyprus with crafting that nation's national security strategy.

"(19) The United States Government provides training to Cypriot officials in areas such as cybersecurity, counterterrorism, and explosive ordnance disposal and stockpile management.

"(20) Israel, Greece, and Cyprus are valued members of the Proliferation Security Initiative to combat the trafficking of weapons of mass destruction.

"(21) The Republic of Cyprus continues to work closely with the United Nations and regional partners in Europe to combat terrorism and violent extremism.

"(22) Despite robust economic and security relations with the United States, the Republic of Cyprus has been subject to a United States prohibition on the export of defense articles and services since 1987.

"(23) The 1987 arms prohibition was designed to restrict United States arms sales and transfers to the Republic of Cyprus and the occupied part of Cyprus to avoid hindering reunification efforts.

"(24) At least 40,000 Turkish troops are stationed in the occupied part of Cyprus with some weapons procured from the United States through mainland Turkey.

"(25) While the United States has, as a matter of policy, avoided the provision of defense articles and services to the Republic of Cyprus, the Government of Cyprus has, in the past, sought to obtain defense articles from other countries, including countries, such as Russia, that pose challenges to United States interests around the world.

"(9) to support efforts to counter Russian Federation interference and influence in the Eastern Mediterranean through increased security cooperation with Greece, Cyprus, and Israel, to include intelligence sharing, cyber, and maritime domain awareness;

"(10) to support the Republic of Cyprus' efforts to regulate its banking industry to ensure that it is not used as a source of international money laundering and encourage additional measures toward that end;

"(11) to strongly oppose any actions that would trigger mandatory sanctions pursuant to section 231 of the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) (Public Law 115–44) [22 U.S.C. 9525], to include the purchase of military equipment from the Russian Federation;
