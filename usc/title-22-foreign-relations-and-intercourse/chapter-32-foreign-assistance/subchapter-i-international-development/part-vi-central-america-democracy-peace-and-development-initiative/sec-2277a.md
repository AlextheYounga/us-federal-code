### §2277a. Targeted sanctions to fight corruption in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras ###

#### (a) Sense of Congress ####

It is the sense of Congress that—

(1) corruption in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras by private citizens and select officials in local, regional, and Federal governments significantly damages the economies of such countries and deprives citizens of opportunities;

(2) corruption in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras is facilitated and carried out not only by private citizens and select officials from those countries but also in many instances by individuals from third countries; and

(3) imposing targeted sanctions on individuals from throughout the world and particularly in the Western Hemisphere who are engaged in acts of significant corruption that impact El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras or obstruction of investigations into such acts of corruption will benefit the citizens and governments of such countries.

#### (b) Report required ####

Not later than 180 days after December 27, 2020, and not less frequently than annually thereafter, the President shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees an unclassified report with classified annex if necessary that identifies each foreign person who the President determines to have knowingly engaged in actions that undermine democratic processes or institutions, or in significant corruption or obstruction of investigations into such acts of corruption in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, including the following:

(1) Corruption related to government contracts.

(2) Bribery and extortion.

(3) The facilitation or transfer of the proceeds of corruption, including through money laundering.

(4) Acts of violence, harassment, or intimidation directed at governmental and nongovernmental corruption investigators.
