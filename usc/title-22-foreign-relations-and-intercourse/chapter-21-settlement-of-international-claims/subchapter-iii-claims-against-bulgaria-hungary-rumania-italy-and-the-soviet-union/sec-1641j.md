### §1641j. Claims by corporations or other legal entities ###

(a) If a corporation or other legal entity has a claim on which an award may be made under this subchapter, no award may be made to any other person under this subchapter with respect to such claim.

(b) A claim based upon an interest, direct or indirect, in a corporation or other legal entity which directly suffered the loss with respect to which the claim is asserted, but which was not a national of the United States at the time of the loss, shall be acted upon without regard to the nationality of such legal entity if at the time of the loss at least 25 per centum of the outstanding capital stock or other beneficial interest in such entity was owned, directly or indirectly, by natural persons who were nationals of the United States. This subsection shall not be construed so as to exclude from eligibility a claim based upon a direct ownership interest in a corporation, association, or other entity, or the property thereof, for loss by reason of the nationalization, compulsory liquidation, or other taking of such corporation, association, or other entity by the Governments of Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy, Rumania, or the Soviet Government. Any such claim may be allowed without regard to the per centum of ownership vested in the claimant.
