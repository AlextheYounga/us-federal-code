#### **Editorial Notes** ####

#### References in Text ####

Section 5941, referred to in subsec. (b), is unidentifiable in the original. Although Pub. L. 117–263 does contain a section 5941, that section is outside the BURMA Act of 2022, which comprises this chapter, and relates to the submission of a report by the Secretary of Agriculture on wholesale produce markets. Prior versions of the Act included a section requiring a report containing a study of the feasibility and desirability of a transitional justice mechanism for Burma, but that section did not appear in the version of the Act enacted by Pub. L. 117–263.
