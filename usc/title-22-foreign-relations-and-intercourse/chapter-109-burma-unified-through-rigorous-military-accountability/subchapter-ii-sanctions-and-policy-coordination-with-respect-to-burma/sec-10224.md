### §10224. Support for greater United Nations action with respect to Burma ###

#### (a) Sense of Congress ####

It is the sense of Congress that—

(1) the United Nations Security Council has not taken adequate steps to condemn the February 1, 2021, coup in Burma, pressure the Burmese military to cease its violence against civilians, or secure the release of those unjustly detained;

(2) countries, such as the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation, that are directly or indirectly shielding the Burmese military from international scrutiny and action, should be obliged to endure the reputational damage of doing so by taking public votes on resolutions related to Burma that apply greater pressure on the Burmese military to restore Burma to its democratic path; and

(3) the United Nations Secretariat and the United Nations Security Council should take concrete steps to address the coup and ongoing crisis in Burma consistent with United Nations General Assembly resolution 75/287, "The situation in Myanmar," which was adopted on June 18, 2021.

#### (b) Support for greater action ####

The President shall direct the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations to use the voice, vote, and influence of the United States to spur greater action by the United Nations and the United Nations Security Council with respect to Burma by—

(1) pushing the United Nations Security Council to consider a resolution condemning the February 1, 2021, coup and calling on the Burmese military to cease its violence against the people of Burma and release without preconditions the journalists, pro-democracy activists, and political officials that it has unjustly detained;

(2) pushing the United Nations Security Council to consider a resolution that immediately imposes a global arms embargo against Burma to ensure that the Burmese military is not able to obtain weapons and munitions from other nations to further harm, murder, and oppress the people of Burma;

(3) pushing the United Nations and other United Nations authorities to cut off assistance to the Government of Burma while providing humanitarian assistance directly to the people of Burma through United Nations bodies and civil society organizations, particularly such organizations working with ethnic minorities that have been adversely affected by the coup and the Burmese military's violent crackdown; and

(4) spurring the United Nations Security Council to consider multilateral sanctions against the Burmese military for its atrocities against Rohingya and individuals of other ethnic and religious minorities, its coup, and the atrocities it has and continues to commit in the coup's aftermath.

#### (c) Sense of Congress ####

It is the sense of Congress that the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations should use the voice, vote, and influence of the United States to—

(1) object to the appointment of representatives to the United Nations and United Nations bodies such as the Human Rights Council that are sanctioned by the Burmese military; and

(2) work to ensure the Burmese military is not recognized as the legitimate government of Burma in any United Nations body.
