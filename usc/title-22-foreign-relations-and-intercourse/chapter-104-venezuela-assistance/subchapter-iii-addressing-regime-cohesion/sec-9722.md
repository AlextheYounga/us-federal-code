Section 5(a) of the Venezuela Defense of Human Rights and Civil Society Act of 2014, referred to in subsec. (b)(1), is section 5(a) of Pub. L. 113–278, Dec. 18, 2014, 128 Stat. 3011, which is set out in a note under section 1701 of Title 50, War and National Defense. Section 5(a) was not amended by section 163 of title I of div. J of Pub. L. 116–94 and does not contain a par. (4) or (5). However, an earlier version of the Act comprising such title I (S. 1025 of the 116th Cong., 1st Sess.) contained a section 603 that did amend section 5(a) of Pub. L. 113–278 by redesignating par. (3) as (5) and adding new pars. (3) and (4) relating to sanctions on persons undermining democratic governance and responsible for public corruption. That amendment was not included anywhere in the version enacted by Pub. L. 116–94.
