(1) The preparation for and management of United States participation in international negotiations and implementation fora in the arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament field.

(2) The conduct, support, and coordination of research for arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament policy formulation.

(3) The preparation for, operation of, or direction of, United States participation in such control systems as may become part of United States arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament activities.

(4) The dissemination and coordination of public information concerning arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament.
