#### (2) Special watch list ####

#### (A) Submission of list ####

Not later than the date on which the determinations described in subsections (c) and (d) are submitted to the appropriate congressional committees in accordance with such subsections, the Secretary of State shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a list of countries that the Secretary determines requires special scrutiny during the following year. The list shall be composed of the following countries:

(ii) Countries that have been listed pursuant to paragraph (1)(B) pursuant to the current annual report and were listed pursuant to paragraph (1)(C) in the previous annual report.

(iii) Countries that have been listed pursuant to paragraph (1)(B) pursuant to the current annual report, where—

(I) the absolute number of victims of severe forms of trafficking is very significant or is significantly increasing;

(II) there is a failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts to combat severe forms of trafficking in persons from the previous year, including increased investigations, prosecutions and convictions of trafficking crimes, increased assistance to victims, and decreasing evidence of complicity in severe forms of trafficking by government officials; or

#### (B) Interim assessment ####

Not later than February 1st of each year, the Secretary of State shall provide to the appropriate congressional committees an assessment of the progress that each country on the special watch list described in subparagraph (A) has made since the last annual report.

#### (C) Relation of special watch list to annual trafficking in persons report ####

A determination that a country shall not be placed on the special watch list described in subparagraph (A) shall not affect in any way the determination to be made in the following year as to whether a country is complying with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking or whether a country is making significant efforts to bring itself into compliance with such standards.

#### (D) Countries on special watch list for 2 consecutive years ####

#### (i) In general ####

Except as provided under clause (ii), a country that is included on the special watch list described in subparagraph (A) for 2 consecutive years after December 23, 2008, shall be included on the list of countries described in paragraph (1)(C).

#### (ii) Exercise of waiver authority ####

The President may waive the application of clause (i) for up to 2 years if the President determines, and reports credible evidence to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives, that such a waiver is justified because—

(I) the country has a written plan to begin making significant efforts to bring itself into compliance with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking;

(II) the plan, if implemented, would constitute making such significant efforts; and

(III) the country is devoting sufficient resources to implement the plan.

#### (E) Public notice ####

Not later than 30 days after notifying Congress of each country determined to have met the requirements under subclauses (I) through (III) of subparagraph (D)(ii), the Secretary of State shall provide a detailed description of the credible evidence supporting such determination on a publicly available website maintained by the Department of State.

#### (3) Significant efforts ####

In determinations under paragraph (1) or (2) as to whether the government of a country is making significant efforts to bring itself into compliance with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking, the Secretary of State shall consider—

(A) the extent to which the country is a country of origin, transit, or destination for severe forms of trafficking;

(B) the extent of noncompliance with the minimum standards by the government and, particularly, the extent to which officials or employees of the government have participated in, facilitated, condoned, or are otherwise complicit in severe forms of trafficking; and

(C) what measures are reasonable to bring the government into compliance with the minimum standards in light of the resources and capabilities of the government.

#### (c) Notification ####

Not less than 45 days or more than 90 days after the submission, on or after January 1, 2003, of an annual report under subsection (b)(1), or an interim report under subsection (b)(2), the President shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a notification of one of the determinations listed in subsection (d) with respect to each foreign country whose government, according to such report—

(A) does not comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; and

(B) is not making significant efforts to bring itself into compliance, as described in subsection (b)(1)(C).

#### (d) Presidential determinations ####

The determinations referred to in subsection (c) are the following:

#### (1) Withholding of nonhumanitarian, nontrade-related assistance ####

The President has determined that—

(A)(i) the United States will not provide nonhumanitarian, nontrade-related foreign assistance to the government of the country for the subsequent fiscal year until such government complies with the minimum standards or makes significant efforts to bring itself into compliance; or

(ii) in the case of a country whose government received no nonhumanitarian, nontrade-related foreign assistance from the United States during the previous fiscal year, the United States will not provide such assistance to the government of the country for the subsequent fiscal year and will not provide funding for participation by officials or employees of such governments in educational and cultural exchange programs for the subsequent fiscal year until such government complies with the minimum standards or makes significant efforts to bring itself into compliance; and

(B) the President will instruct the United States Executive Director of each multilateral development bank and of the International Monetary Fund to vote against, and to use the Executive Director's best efforts to deny, any loan or other utilization of the funds of the respective institution to that country (other than for humanitarian assistance, for trade-related assistance, or for development assistance which directly addresses basic human needs, is not administered by the government of the sanctioned country, and confers no benefit to that government) for the subsequent fiscal year until such government complies with the minimum standards or makes significant efforts to bring itself into compliance.

#### (2) Ongoing, multiple, broad-based restrictions on assistance in response to human rights violations ####

The President has determined that such country is already subject to multiple, broad-based restrictions on assistance imposed in significant part in response to human rights abuses and such restrictions are ongoing and are comparable to the restrictions provided in paragraph (1). Such determination shall be accompanied by a description of the specific restriction or restrictions that were the basis for making such determination.

#### (3) Subsequent compliance ####

The Secretary of State has determined that the government of the country has come into compliance with the minimum standards or is making significant efforts to bring itself into compliance.

#### (4) Continuation of assistance in the national interest ####

Notwithstanding the failure of the government of the country to comply with minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and to make significant efforts to bring itself into compliance, the President has determined that the provision to the country of nonhumanitarian, nontrade-related foreign assistance or funding for participation in educational and cultural exchange programs, or the multilateral assistance described in paragraph (1)(B), or both, would promote the purposes of this chapter or is otherwise in the national interest of the United States.

#### (5) Exercise of waiver authority ####

#### (A) In general ####

The President may exercise the authority under paragraph (4) with respect to—

(i) all nonhumanitarian, nontrade-related foreign assistance or funding for participation in educational and cultural exchange programs to a country;

(iii) one or more programs, projects, or activities of such assistance.

#### (f) Subsequent waiver authority ####

After the President has made a determination described in subsection (d)(1) with respect to the government of a country, the President may at any time make a determination described in paragraphs (4) and (5) of subsection (d) to waive, in whole or in part, the measures imposed against the country by the previous determination under subsection (d)(1).

Memorandum for the Secretary of State

Consistent with section 110 of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7107) (the "Act"), as amended, I hereby determine as follows:

Section 1. As provided for in section 110(d)(1)(A)(i) of the Act, I determine that the United States will not provide nonhumanitarian, nontrade-related assistance to the governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Equatorial Guinea, Iran, South Sudan, Sudan, and Venezuela during Fiscal Year (FY) 2018, except that such assistance may be provided to such a government if, in a report to the Congress under section 110(b) of the Act, the Secretary of State determines that the government complies with the Act's minimum standards or has made significant efforts to bring itself into compliance with the Act.

Sec. 2. As provided in section 110(d)(1)(A)(ii) of the Act, I determine that the United States will not provide nonhumanitarian, nontrade-related assistance to, or allow funding for participation in educational and cultural exchange programs by officials or employees of, the governments of Eritrea, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Russia, and Syria for FY 2018, except that such assistance may be provided to, or such funding may be allowed for officials of, such a government if, in a report to the Congress under section 110(b) of the Act, the Secretary of State determines that the government complies with the Act's minimum standards or has made significant efforts to bring itself into compliance with the Act.

Sec. 3.. [sic] As provided in section 110(d)(1)(B) of the Act, I hereby instruct the United States Executive Director of each multilateral development bank, as defined in the Act, and of the International Monetary Fund to vote against and use best efforts to deny all loans to, and all other uses of those institutions' funds that benefit, the governments of Iran, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Russia for FY 2018. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive Directors may vote to allow loans to be made, and the institutions' funds to be used for, humanitarian assistance; trade-related assistance; and development assistance that directly addresses basic human needs, is not administered by the government of such country, and confers no benefit to such a government. They may also vote to allow loans to be made to, and the institutions' funds to be used to benefit, any such government that complies with the minimum standards of the Act or makes significant efforts to bring itself into compliance with the Act.

Sec. 4. Consistent with section 110(d)(4) of the Act, I determine that a partial waiver of the Act with respect to the DRC and South Sudan to allow assistance described in section 110(d)(1)(A)(i) of the Act—with exception for Foreign Military Financing (FMF), Foreign Military Sales (FMS), International Military Education and Training (IMET), and Excess Defense Articles (EDA)—would promote the purposes of the Act or is otherwise in the national interest of the United States.

Sec. 5. Consistent with section 110(d)(4) of the Act, I determine that a partial waiver of the Act with respect to Equatorial Guinea to allow assistance described in section 110(d)(1)(A)(i) of the Act for programs to promote sustainable natural resource management and biodiversity and programs to advance energy access, support regional training to combat infectious diseases, and participation in the Young African Leaders Initiative would promote the purposes of the Act or is otherwise in the national interest of the United States.

Sec. 6. Consistent with section 110(d)(4) of the Act, I determine that a partial waiver of the Act with respect to Sudan to allow assistance described in section 110(d)(1)(A)(i) of the Act—with exception for FMF, FMS, IMET, and EDA—would promote the purposes of the Act or is otherwise in the national interest of the United States.

Sec. 7. Consistent with section 110(d)(4) of the Act, I determine that a partial waiver of the Act with respect to Venezuela to allow assistance described in section 110(d)(1)(A)(i) of the Act for health programs, programs designed to strengthen the democratic process in Venezuela, and for government officials and employees to participate in foreign assistance-funded programs related to democracy and the rule of law would promote the purposes of the Act or is otherwise in the national interest of the United States.

Sec. 8. Consistent with section 110(d)(4) of the Act, I determine that a partial waiver of the Act with respect to Eritrea, Russia, and Syria to allow assistance described in section 110(d)(1)(A)(ii) of the Act for educational and cultural exchange programs would promote the purposes of the Act or is otherwise in the national interest of the United States.

Sec. 9. Consistent with section 110(d)(4) of the Act, I determine that the provision of all programs, projects, and activities described in section 110(d)(1)(A)(i) of the Act to the governments of Belarus, Belize, Burundi, the Central African Republic, China, Comoros, Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Mauritania, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan would promote the purposes of the Act or is otherwise in the national interest of the United States.

Sec. 10. Consistent with section 110(d)(4) of the Act, I determine that providing the assistance described in section 110(d)(1)(B) of the Act to Belarus, Belize, Burundi, the Central African Republic, China, Comoros, DRC, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Mauritania, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela would promote the purposes of the Act or is otherwise in the national interest of the United States.

Sec. 11. You are authorized and directed to submit this determination, the certification required by section 110(e) of the Act, and the Department of State's Memorandum of Justification, on which I have relied, to the Congress, and to publish the determination in the Federal Register.
