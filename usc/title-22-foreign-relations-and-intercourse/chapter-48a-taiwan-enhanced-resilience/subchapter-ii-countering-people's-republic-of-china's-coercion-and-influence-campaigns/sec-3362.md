### §3362. Task force to counter economic coercion by the People's Republic of China ###

#### (a) Sense of Congress ####

It is the sense of Congress that—

(1) the People's Republic of China's (PRC) increasing use of economic coercion against foreign governments, companies, organizations, other entities, and individuals requires that the United States devise a comprehensive, effective, and multilateral response;

(2) the private sector is a crucial partner in helping the United States Government respond to the PRC's coercive economic practices and hold the PRC accountable;

(3) improved engagement and communication with the private sector, including receiving information from the United States private sector about the PRC's coercive economic practices would help the United States Government and private sector stakeholders conduct early assessments of potential pressure points and vulnerabilities; and

(4) PRC coercive economic practices create pressures for the private sector to behave in ways antithetical to United States national interests and competitiveness.

#### (b) Establishment of Task Force ####

Not later than 180 days after December 23, 2022, the President shall establish an interagency task force to be known as the "Countering Economic Coercion Task Force" (referred to in this section as the "Task Force").
