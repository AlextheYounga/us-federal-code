#### (1) Detail authorized ####

With the approval of the Secretary of State, an agency head may detail, for a period of not more than 2 years, an employee of the agency of the United States Government who has been awarded a fellowship under this subchapter, to the American Institute in Taiwan for the purpose of assignment to Taiwan or an organization described in section 3384(d)(2)(B) of this title.

#### (2) Agreement ####

Each detailee shall enter into a written agreement with the Federal Government before receiving a fellowship, in which the fellow shall agree—

(A) to continue in the service of the sponsoring agency at the end of fellowship for a period of at least 4 years (or at least 2 years if the fellowship duration is 1 year or shorter) unless the detailee is involuntarily separated from the service of such agency; and

(B) to pay to the American Institute in Taiwan, or the United States Government agency, as appropriate, any additional expenses incurred by the Federal Government in connection with the fellowship if the detailee voluntarily separates from service with the sponsoring agency before the end of the period for which the detailee has agreed to continue in the service of such agency.

#### (3) Exception ####

The payment agreed to under paragraph (2)(B) may not be required from a detailee who leaves the service of the sponsoring agency to enter into the service of another agency of the United States Government unless the head of the sponsoring agency notifies the detailee before the effective date of entry into the service of the other agency that payment will be required under this subsection.

#### (b) Status as government employee ####

A detailee—

(1) is deemed, for the purpose of preserving allowances, privileges, rights, seniority, and other benefits, to be an employee of the sponsoring agency;

(2) is entitled to pay, allowances, and benefits from funds available to such agency, which is deemed to comply with section 5536 of title 5; and

(3) may be assigned to a position with an entity described in section 3384(d)(2)(A) of this title if acceptance of such position does not involve—

(A) the taking of an oath of allegiance to another government; or

(B) the acceptance of compensation or other benefits from any foreign government by such detailee.

#### (c) Responsibilities of sponsoring agency ####

#### (1) In general ####

The Federal agency from which a detailee is detailed should provide the fellow allowances and benefits that are consistent with Department of State Standardized Regulations or other applicable rules and regulations, including—

(A) a living quarters allowance to cover the cost of housing in Taiwan;
