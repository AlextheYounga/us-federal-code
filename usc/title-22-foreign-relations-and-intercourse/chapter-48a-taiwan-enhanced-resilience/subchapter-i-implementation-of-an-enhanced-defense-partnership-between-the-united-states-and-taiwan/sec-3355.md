#### (b) Elements ####

The plan required by subsection (a) shall include the following:

(1) An identification of the defensive military capability gaps and capacity shortfalls of Taiwan that are required to—

(5) An assessment of—

(A) the capability gaps and capacity shortfalls that could be addressed in a sufficient and timely manner by Taiwan; and

(B) the capability gaps and capacity shortfalls that are unlikely to be addressed in a sufficient and timely manner solely by Taiwan.

(A) table-top exercises and wargames that allow operational commands to improve joint and combined planning for contingencies involving a well-equipped adversary in a counter-intervention campaign;

(B) joint and combined exercises that test the feasibility of counter-intervention strategies, develop interoperability across services, and develop the lethality and survivability of combined forces against a well-equipped adversary;

(C) logistics exercises that test the feasibility of expeditionary logistics in an extended campaign with a well-equipped adversary;

(D) service-to-service exercise programs that build functional mission skills for addressing challenges posed by a well-equipped adversary in a counter-intervention campaign; and

(E) any other combined training, exercises, or planning with Taiwan's military forces that the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State consider relevant.

(9) An identification of options for the United States to use, to the maximum extent practicable, existing authorities or programs to expedite military assistance to Taiwan in the event of a crisis or conflict, including—
