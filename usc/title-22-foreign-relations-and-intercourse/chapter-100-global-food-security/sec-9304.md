### §9304. Comprehensive Global Food Security Strategy ###

#### (a) Strategy ####

The President shall coordinate the development and implementation of a United States whole-of-government strategy to accomplish the policy objectives set forth in section 9302(a) of this title, which shall—

(1) set specific and measurable goals, benchmarks, timetables, performance metrics, and monitoring and evaluation plans that reflect international best practices relating to transparency, accountability, food and nutrition security, and agriculture-led economic growth, consistent with the policy objectives described in section 9302(a) of this title;

(2) establish clear and transparent selection criteria for target countries, communities, regions, and intended beneficiaries of assistance;

(3) describe the methodology and criteria for the selection of target countries;

(4) support and be aligned with partner country-led agriculture, nutrition, regulatory, food security, and water resources management policy and investment plans and governance systems developed with input from key stakeholders, as appropriate;

(5) support the locally-led and inclusive development of agriculture and food systems, including by enhancing the extent to which small-scale food producers, especially women, have access to and control over the inputs, skills, resource management capacity, networking, bargaining power, financing, market linkages, technology, and information needed to sustainably increase productivity and incomes, reduce poverty and malnutrition, and promote long-term economic prosperity;

(6) support improvement of the nutritional status of women, adolescent girls, and children, particularly during the critical first 1,000-day window until a child reaches 2 years of age and with a focus on reducing child stunting and preventing incidence of wasting, through nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive programs, including related water, sanitation, and hygiene programs;

(7) facilitate communication and collaboration, as appropriate, among local stakeholders in support of a multi-sectoral approach to food and nutrition security, to include analysis of the multiple underlying causes of malnutrition, including poor water resource management and lack of access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene;

(8) support long-term impact by building the capacity of local organizations and institutions, including agricultural research capacity, in target countries and communities;

(9) coordinate with and complement relevant strategies to ensure that chronically vulnerable populations are better able to adapt, build safety nets, secure livelihoods, access markets, and access opportunities for longer-term economic growth;

(10) develop community and producer resilience and adaptation strategies to disasters, emergencies, and other shocks and stresses to food and nutrition security, including conflicts, droughts, flooding, pests, and diseases, that adversely impact agricultural yield and livelihoods;

(11) harness science, technology, and innovation, including the research and extension activities supported by the private sector, relevant Federal departments and agencies, Feed the Future Innovation Labs or any successor entities, and international and local researchers and innovators, recognizing that significant investments in research and technological advances will be necessary to reduce global poverty, hunger, and malnutrition;

(12) use evidenced-based best practices, including scientific and forecasting data, and improved planning and coordination by, with, and among key partners and relevant Federal departments and agencies to identify, analyze, measure, and mitigate risks, and strengthen resilience capacities;

(13) ensure scientific and forecasting data is accessible and usable by affected communities and facilitate communication and collaboration among local stakeholders in support of adaptation planning and implementation, including scenario planning and preparedness using seasonal forecasting and scientific and local knowledge;

(14) integrate agricultural development activities among food insecure populations living in proximity to designated national parks or wildlife areas into wildlife conservation efforts, as necessary and appropriate;

(15) leverage resources and expertise through partnerships with the private sector, farm organizations, cooperatives, civil society, nongovernmental organizations, including faith-based organizations, and agricultural research and academic institutions;

(16) strengthen and expand collaboration and coordination, as appropriate, between United States universities, including public, private, and land-grant universities, with higher education institutions in target countries to increase their effectiveness and relevance to promote agricultural development and innovation through the creation of human capital, innovation, and cutting edge science in the agricultural sector;

(17) seek to ensure that target countries and communities respect and promote land tenure rights of local communities, particularly those of women and small-scale producers;

(18) include criteria and methodologies for graduating target countries and communities from assistance provided to implement the Global Food Security Strategy as such countries and communities meet the progress benchmarks identified pursuant to section 9307(a)(4) of this title;

(19) improve the efficiency and resilience of agricultural production, including management of crops, rangelands, pastures, livestock, fisheries, and aquacultures;

(20) ensure investments in food and nutrition security consider and integrate best practices in the management and governance of natural resources and conservation, especially among food insecure populations living in or near biodiverse ecosystems;

(21) be periodically updated in a manner that reflects learning and best practices; and

(22) demonstrably support the United States national security and economic interest in the countries where assistance is being provided.

#### (b) Coordination ####

The President shall coordinate, through a whole-of-government approach, the efforts of relevant Federal departments and agencies in the implementation of the Global Food Security Strategy by—

(1) establishing monitoring and evaluation systems, coherence, and coordination across relevant Federal departments and agencies;

(2) establishing linkages with other initiatives and strategies of relevant Federal departments and agencies; and

(3) establishing platforms for regular consultation and collaboration with key stakeholders and the appropriate congressional committees.

#### (c) Strategy submission ####
