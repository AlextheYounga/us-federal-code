#### **Editorial Notes** ####

#### Codification ####

This subchapter consists of part 2 of subtitle D of title V of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, Pub. L. 103–182. Section 601 of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act, Pub. L. 116–113, repealed Pub. L. 103–182, effective on the date the USMCA entered into force (July 1, 2020). However, section 601 of div. O of Pub. L. 116–260 provided that section 601 of Pub. L. 116–113 does not apply to part 2 of subtitle D of title V of Pub. L. 103–182 and revived the provisions of such part 2 as if section 601 of Pub. L. 116–113 had not been enacted.
