### SUBCHAPTER XXVIII—NORTH AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK AND RELATED PROVISIONS ###

#### Codification ####

This subchapter consists of part 2 of subtitle D of title V of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, Pub. L. 103–182. Section 601 of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act, Pub. L. 116–113, repealed Pub. L. 103–182, effective on the date the USMCA entered into force (July 1, 2020). The repeal of this subchapter, however, was probably not intended to be included in the repeal of Pub. L. 103–182 as a whole. As a result, this subchapter is still being set out, with a notation under each section enacted by Pub. L. 103–182 that it has technically been repealed.
