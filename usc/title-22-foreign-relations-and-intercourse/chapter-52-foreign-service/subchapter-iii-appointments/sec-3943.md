Memorandum for the Secretary of State

By the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including section 301 of title 3 of the United States Code and section 136 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1986 and 1987 (Public Law 99–93) ("the Act") [set out as a note above], I hereby determine that implementation of section 136(a) of the Act poses undue practical and administrative difficulties.

Further, I delegate to you the responsibility vested in me by section 136(b) of the Act to report to the Congress on circumstances relevant to this determination. Such responsibility may be redelegated within the Department of State.

You are authorized and directed to report this determination to the Congress and to publish it in the Federal Register.

George Bush.
