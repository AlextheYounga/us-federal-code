(3) as a career candidate, if—

(A) continued service is determined appropriate to remedy a matter that would be cognizable as a grievance under subchapter XI; or

(B) the individual is serving in the uniformed services (as defined in section 4303 of title 38) and the limited appointment expires in the course of such service;

(4) as a career employee in another Federal personnel system serving in a Foreign Service position on detail from another agency;

(5) as a foreign national employee;

(6) in exceptional circumstances if the Secretary determines the needs of the Service require the extension of—

(A) a limited noncareer appointment for a period not to exceed 1 year; or

(B) a limited appointment of a career candidate for the minimum time needed to resolve a grievance, claim, investigation, or complaint not otherwise provided for in this section.

(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) noncareer employees who have served for 5 consecutive years under a limited appointment under this section may be reappointed to a subsequent noncareer limited appointment if there is at least a 1-year break in service before such new appointment.

(2) The Secretary may waive the 1-year break requirement under paragraph (1) in cases of special need.
