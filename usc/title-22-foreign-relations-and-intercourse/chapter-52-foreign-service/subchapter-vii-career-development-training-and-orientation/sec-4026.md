(B) to ensure that notice of any vacant position in the Department is provided in a manner reasonably designed to reach eligible family members of sponsoring employees whose permanent duty stations are in the same country as that in which the position is located; and

(C) to ensure that an eligible family member who applies for a vacant position in the Department shall, to the extent practicable, be considered for any such position located in the same country as the permanent duty station of their sponsoring employee.

(3) Nothing in this section may be construed to provide an eligible family member with entitlement or preference in hiring over an individual who is preference eligible.

(4) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, a chief of mission may, consistent with all applicable laws and regulations pertaining to the ICASS system, make available to an eligible family member and a non-Department entity space in an embassy or consulate for the purpose of the non-Department entity providing employment-related training for eligible family members.

(5) The Secretary may work with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management and the heads of other Federal departments and agencies to expand and facilitate the use of existing Federal programs and resources in support of eligible family member employment.

(6) The Secretary shall establish a family liaison office to carry out this subsection and such other functions as the Secretary may determine.

(7) In this subsection, the term "eligible family member" refers to family members of government employees assigned abroad or hired for service at their post of residence who are appointed by the Secretary of State or the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development pursuant to sections 3902, 3922, 3943, and 3951 of this title.
