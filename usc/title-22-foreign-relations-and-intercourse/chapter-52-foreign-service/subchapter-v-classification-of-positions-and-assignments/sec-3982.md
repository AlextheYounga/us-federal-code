"(1) Entry-level foreign service personnel.—The Secretary [of State] shall adopt policies and procedures to facilitate the assignment of entry-level tandem Foreign Service personnel on directed assignments to the same diplomatic post or country as their tandem spouse if they request to be assigned to the same post or country. The Secretary shall also provide a written justification to the requesting personnel explaining any denial of a request that would result in tandem spouses not serving together at the same post or country.

"(2) Tenured foreign service personnel.—The Secretary shall add family togetherness to the criteria when making a needs of the Service determination, as defined by the Foreign Affairs Manual, for the placement of tenured tandem Foreign Service personnel at United States diplomatic posts.

"(3) Updates to antinepotism policy.—The Secretary shall update antinepotism policies so that nepotism rules only apply when an employee and a relative are placed into positions wherein they jointly and exclusively control government resources, property, or money or establish government policy.

"(4) Temporary supervision of tandem spouse.—The Secretary shall update policies to allow for a tandem spouse to temporarily supervise another tandem spouse for up to 90 days in a calendar year, including at a United States diplomatic mission.

"(d) Report.—Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this division, and annually thereafter for two years, the Secretary shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees [Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives] a report that includes—

"(1) the number of Foreign Service tandem spouses currently serving;

"(2) the number of Foreign Service tandems currently serving in separate locations, or, to the extent possible, that are on leave without pay (LWOP); and
