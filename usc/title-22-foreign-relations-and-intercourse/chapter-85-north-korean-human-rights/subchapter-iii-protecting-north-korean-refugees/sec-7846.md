### §7846. Sense of Congress on humanitarian coordination related to the Korean Peninsula ###

It is the sense of Congress that—

(1) any instability on the Korean Peninsula could have significant humanitarian and strategic impact on the region and for United States national interests; and

(2) as such, the United States Government should work with countries sharing a land or maritime border with North Korea to develop long-term whole-of-government plans to coordinate efforts related to humanitarian assistance and human rights promotion and to effectively assimilate North Korean defectors.
