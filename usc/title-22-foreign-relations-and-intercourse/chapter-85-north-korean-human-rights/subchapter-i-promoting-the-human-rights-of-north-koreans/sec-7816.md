### §7816. Establishment of regional framework ###

#### (a) Findings ####

The Congress finds that human rights initiatives can be undertaken on a multilateral basis, such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which established a regional framework for discussing human rights, scientific and educational cooperation, and economic and trade issues.

#### (b) Sense of Congress ####

It is the sense of Congress that the United Sates <sup><a href="#7816_1_target" name="7816_1">1</a></sup> should explore the possibility of a regional human rights dialogue with North Korea that is modeled on the Helsinki process, engaging all countries in the region in a common commitment to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms.
