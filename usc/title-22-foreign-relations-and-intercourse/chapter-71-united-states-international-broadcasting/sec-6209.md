#### **Editorial Notes** ####

#### References in Text ####

This chapter, referred to in subsecs. (a), (c), and (d), probably should have been a reference to "this title", meaning title III of Pub. L. 103–236, Apr. 30, 1994, 108 Stat. 432, known as the United States International Broadcasting Act of 1994, which is classified principally to this chapter. For complete classification of title III to the Code, see Short Title note set out under section 6201 of this title and Tables.

#### Codification ####

Pub. L. 116–283, div. A, title XII, §1299Q(e)(5), (f), Jan. 1, 2021, 134 Stat. 4025, 4026, which amended this section, was itself amended by Pub. L. 116–260, div. O, title XIII, §1301, Dec. 27, 2020, 134 Stat. 2158, to make it effective 90 days after Jan. 1, 2021. However, the amendment by Pub.
