#### **Editorial Notes** ####

#### References in Text ####

The date of the enactment of the U.S. Agency for Global Media Reform Act, referred to in subsec. (b)(4)(A), probably means the date of enactment of section 1299Q of Pub. L. 116–283, which was approved Jan. 1, 2021. A bill with that Short Title, S. 3654, was introduced in the 115th Congress, 2nd Session, but was not enacted. Provisions similar to those in subsec. (b) of this section, as added by section 1299Q of Pub. L. 116–283, were contained in section 3 of the bill.

This chapter, referred to in subsecs. (e)(1) and (f)(3), was in the original "this title", meaning title III of Pub. L. 103–236, Apr. 30, 1994, 108 Stat. 432, known as the United States International Broadcasting Act of 1994, which is classified principally to this chapter. For complete classification of title III to the Code, see Short Title note set out under section 6201 of this title and Tables.
