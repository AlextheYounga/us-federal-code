Pub. L. 116–283, div. A, title XII, §1299Q(e)(11), Jan. 1, 2021, 134 Stat. 4026, which amended this section, was itself amended by Pub. L. 116–260, div.

#### Finding; Sense of Congress ####

Pub. L. 110–53, title XX, §2031(a), (b), Aug. 3, 2007, 121 Stat. 515, provided that:

"(a) Finding.—Congress finds that the report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States stated that 'Recognizing that Arab and Muslim audiences rely on satellite television and radio, the government has begun some promising initiatives in television and radio broadcasting to the Arab world, Iran, and Afghanistan. These efforts are beginning to reach large audiences. The Broadcasting Board of Governors [now United States Agency for Global Media] has asked for much larger resources. It should get them.'.

"(b) Sense of Congress.—It is the sense of Congress that—

"(1) the United States needs to improve its communication of information and ideas to people in foreign countries, particularly in countries with significant Muslim populations; and

"(2) public diplomacy should reaffirm the paramount commitment of the United States to democratic principles, including preserving the civil liberties of all the people of the United States, including Muslim-Americans."
