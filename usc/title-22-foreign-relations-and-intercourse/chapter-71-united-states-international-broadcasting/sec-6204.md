#### Codification ####

"Chief Executive Officer" was substituted for "Board" in section catchline to reflect the probable intent of Congress and the amendment by Pub. L. 114–328, §1288(2)(A)(i), which substituted "Chief Executive Officer" for "Board" wherever appearing in subsec. (a).

Section is comprised of section 305 of Pub. L. 103–236, which consists of subsecs. (a), (b), (e), and (c), in that order. Subsec. (e) of section 305 of Pub. L. 103–236 amended sections 1465b and 1465c of this title and is omitted from the text of this section. There was no subsec. (c) or (d) after amendment by Pub. L. 114–328, §1288(2)(B)–(D). Pub. L. 116–283, §1299Q(c)(2), which added a new subsec. (c), directed that it be added at the end of this section, which technically places it after subsec. (e) but is shown here as following subsec. (b) due to the omission of subsec. (e).

Pub. L. 116–283, div. A, title XII, §1299Q(c), (e)(2), Jan. 1, 2021, 134 Stat. 4021, 4025, which amended this section, was itself amended by Pub. L. 116–260, div. O, title XIII, §1301, Dec. 27, 2020, 134 Stat. 2158, to make it effective 90 days after Jan. 1, 2021. However, the amendment by Pub. L. 116–260 could not be executed because it was enacted before the provision from Pub. L. 116–283 that it amended.
