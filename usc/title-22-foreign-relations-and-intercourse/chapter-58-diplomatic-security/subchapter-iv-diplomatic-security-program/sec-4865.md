Subject to clause (ii), the Secretary of State may waive subparagraph (A) if the Secretary, in consultation with, as appropriate, the head of each agency employing personnel that would not be located at the site, if applicable, determines that it is in the national interest of the United States after taking account of any considerations the Secretary in his or her discretion considers relevant, which may include security conditions.

#### Findings ####

Pub. L. 117–263, div. I, title XCIII, §9301(b), Dec. 23, 2022, 136 Stat. 3879, provided that: "Congress makes the following findings:

"(1) The Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act of 1999 (title VI of division A of appendix G of Public Law 106–113 [113 Stat. 1501A–451; see Short Title of 1999 Amendment note set out under section 4801 of this title]) was a necessary response to bombings on August 7, 1998, at the United States embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, that were destroyed by simultaneously exploding bombs. The resulting explosions killed 220 persons and injured more than 4,000 others. Twelve Americans and 40 Kenyan and Tanzanian employees of the United States Foreign Service were killed in the attacks.

"(2) Those bombings, followed by the expeditionary diplomatic efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, demonstrated the need to prioritize the security of United States posts and personnel abroad above other considerations.

"(3) Between 1999 and 2022, the risk calculus of the Department [of State] impacted the ability of United States diplomats around the world to advance the interests of the United States through access to local populations, leaders, and places.

"(4) America's competitors and adversaries do not have the same restrictions that United States diplomats have, especially in critically important medium-threat and high-threat posts.

"(5) The Department's 2021 Overseas Security Panel report states that—

"(A) the requirement for setback and collocation of diplomatic posts under paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 606(a) of the Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act of 1999 (22 U.S.C. 4865(a)) has led to skyrocketing costs of new embassies and consulates; and

"(B) the locations of such posts have become less desirable, creating an extremely suboptimal nexus that further hinders United States diplomats who are willing to accept more risk in order to advance United States interests."

Pub. L. 106–113, div. B, §1000(a)(7) [div. A, title VI, §602], Nov. 29, 1999, 113 Stat. 1536, 1501A–451, provided that: "Congress makes the following findings:

"(1) On August 7, 1998, the United States embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, were destroyed by simultaneously exploding bombs. The resulting explosions killed 220 persons and injured more than 4,000 others. Twelve Americans and 40 Kenyan and Tanzanian employees of the United States Foreign Service were killed in the attack.

"(2) The United States personnel in both Dar es Salaam and Nairobi showed leadership and personal courage in their response to the attacks. Despite the havoc wreaked upon the embassies, staff in both embassies provided rapid response in locating and rescuing victims, providing emergency assistance, and quickly restoring embassy operations during a crisis.

"(3) The bombs are believed to have been set by individuals associated with Osama bin Laden, leader of a known transnational terrorist organization. In February 1998, bin Laden issued a directive to his followers that called for attacks against United States interests anywhere in the world.

"(4) Threats continue to be made against United States diplomatic facilities.

"(5) Accountability Review Boards were convened following the bombings, as required by Public Law 99–399 [see Tables for classification], chaired by Admiral William J. Crowe, United States Navy (Ret.) (in this section referred to as the 'Crowe panels').

"(6) The conclusions of the Crowe panels were strikingly similar to those stated by the Commission chaired by Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, which issued an extensive embassy security report in 1985.

"(7) The Crowe panels issued a report setting out many problems with security at United States diplomatic facilities, in particular the following:

"(A) The United States Government has devoted inadequate resources to security against terrorist attacks.

"(B) The United States Government places too low a priority on security concerns.

"(8) The result has been a failure to take adequate steps to prevent tragedies such as the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.

"(9) The Crowe panels found that there was an institutional failure on the part of the Department of State to recognize threats posed by transnational terrorism and vehicular bombs.

"(10) Responsibility for ensuring adequate resources for security programs is widely shared throughout the United States Government, including Congress. Unless the vulnerabilities identified by the Crowe panels are addressed in a sustained and financially realistic manner, the lives and safety of United States employees in diplomatic facilities will continue to be at risk from further terrorist attacks.

"(11) Although service in the Foreign Service or other United States Government positions abroad can never be completely without risk, the United States Government must take all reasonable steps to minimize security risks."

#### Authorizations of Appropriations ####

Pub. L. 117–263, div. I, title XCVIII, §9801, Dec. 23, 2022, 136 Stat. 3923, provided that: "For the purposes of calculating the costs of providing new United States diplomatic facilities in any fiscal year, in accordance with section 604(e) of the Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act of 1999 [Pub. L. 106–113, div. B, §1000(a)(7) [div. A, title VI]] (22 U.S.C. 4865 note), the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, shall determine the annual program level and agency shares for such fiscal year in a manner that is proportional to the contribution of the Department of State for this purpose."

I, title VII, §7004(e), Dec. 23, 2011, 125 Stat. 1194; Pub. L. 114–323, title I, §111(b), Dec. 16, 2016, 130 Stat. 1910, provided that:

"(a) Authorization of Appropriations.—In addition to amounts otherwise authorized to be appropriated by this or any other Act, there are authorized to be appropriated for 'Embassy Security, Construction and Maintenance'—

to the extent necessary to bring the United States Government into compliance with all requirements applicable to the security of United States diplomatic facilities, including the relevant requirements set forth in section 606 [22 U.S.C. 4865].

"(c) Availability of Authorizations.—Authorizations of appropriations under subsection (a) shall remain available until the appropriations are made.

"(d) Availability of Funds.—Amounts appropriated pursuant to subsection (a) are authorized to remain available until expended.

"(e) Capital Security Cost Sharing.—

"(1) Authority.—Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all agencies with personnel overseas subject to chief of mission authority pursuant to section 207 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 (22 U.S.C. 3927) shall participate and provide funding in advance for their share of costs of providing, maintaining, repairing, and renovating safe, secure United States diplomatic facilities, without offsets, on the basis of the total overseas presence of each agency as determined annually by the Secretary of State in consultation with such agency. Amounts advanced by such agencies to the Department of State shall be credited to the Embassy Security, Construction and Maintenance account, and remain available until expended.

"(2) Implementation.—Implementation of this subsection shall be carried out in a manner that encourages right-sizing of each agency's overseas presence. A project to construct a diplomatic facility of the United States may not include office space or other accommodations for an employee of a Federal department or agency to the extent that the Secretary of State determines that such department or agency has not provided to the Department of State the full amount of funding required under paragraph (1), notwithstanding any authorization and appropriation of relevant funds by Congress.

"(3) Exclusion.—For purposes of this subsection 'agency' does not include the Marine Security Guard."
