During the transition period, pending the advice and consent of the Senate to the appointment of an officer required by this chapter to be appointed by and with such advice and consent, the President may designate any officer whose appointment was required to be made by and with such advice and consent and who was such an officer before the end of the transition period (and who continues in office) or immediately before such designation, to act in such office until the same is filled as provided in this chapter.
