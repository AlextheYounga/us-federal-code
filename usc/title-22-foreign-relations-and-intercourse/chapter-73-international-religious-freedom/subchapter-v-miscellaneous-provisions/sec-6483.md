### §6483. Sense of Congress regarding national security strategy to promote religious freedom through United States foreign policy ###

It is the sense of Congress that the annual national security strategy report of the President required under section 3043 of title 50—

(1) should promote international religious freedom as a foreign policy and national security priority; and

(2) should articulate that promotion of the right to freedom of religion is a strategy that—

(A) protects other, related human rights, and advances democracy outside the United States; and

(B) makes clear its importance to United States foreign policy goals of stability, security, development, and diplomacy;

(3) should be a guide for the strategies and activities of relevant Federal agencies; and

(4) should inform the Department of Defense quadrennial defense review under section 118 <sup><a href="#6483_1_target" name="6483_1">1</a></sup> of title 10 and the Department of State Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review.
