Sec. 6. I hereby determine that, to the extent section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) may apply, the making of donations of the types of articles specified in such section by, to, or for the benefit of any sanctioned person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergencies declared in Executive Orders 13660 and 13694 [listed in a table under 50 U.S.C. 1701], and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by sections 1(a)(iv) and 3(a)(i) of this order.

Sec. 7. For the purposes of this order:

(a) the term "person" means an individual or entity;

(b) the term "entity" means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;

(c) the term "United States person" means any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person within the United States;

(d) the term "financial institution" includes: (i) a depository institution (as defined in section 3(c)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(c)(1))), including a branch or agency of a foreign bank (as defined in section 1(b)(7) of the International Banking Act of 1978 (12 U.S.C. 3101(7))); (ii) a credit union; (iii) a securities firm, including a broker or dealer; (iv) an insurance company, including an agency or underwriter; and (v) any other company that provides financial services;

(e) the term "international financial institution" has the meaning given that term in section 1701(c) of the International Financial Institutions Act (22 U.S.C. 262r(c));

(f) the term "United States financial institution" means a financial institution (including its foreign branches) organized under the laws of the United States or of any jurisdiction within the United States or located in the United States; and

(g) the term "sanctioned person" means a person that the President, or the Secretary of State or the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to authority delegated by the President and in accordance with the terms of such delegation, has determined is a person on whom sanctions shall be imposed pursuant to sections 224(a)(2), 224(a)(3), 231(a), 232(a), or 233(a) of CAATSA or sections 4(a) or 4(b) of UFSA and on whom the President, the Secretary of State, or the Secretary of the Treasury has imposed any of the sanctions in section 235 of CAATSA or section 4(c) of UFSA.

Sec. 8. For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken with respect to such property or interests in property pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergencies declared in Executive Orders 13660 and 13694, there need be no prior notice of an action taken pursuant to this order with respect to such property or interests in property.

Sec. 9. The unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens on whom sanctions described in sections 1(a)(iv) or 3(a)(i) of this order have been imposed would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and the entry of such persons into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, is hereby suspended. Such persons shall be treated as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693.

Sec. 10. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA, and sections 224(a)(2), 224(a)(3), 231(a), 231(e), 232(a), 233(a), and 235 of CAATSA and sections 4(a)–(c) and 4(h) of UFSA with respect to powers to impose sanctions, as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the Department of the Treasury. All departments and agencies of the United States Government shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order.

Sec. 11. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:

(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or

(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Donald J. Trump.
