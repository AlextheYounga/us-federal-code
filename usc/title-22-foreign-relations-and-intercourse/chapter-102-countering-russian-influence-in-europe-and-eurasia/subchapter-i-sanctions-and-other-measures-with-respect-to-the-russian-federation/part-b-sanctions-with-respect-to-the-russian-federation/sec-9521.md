#### "SEC. 101. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. ####

"(a) Findings.—Congress makes the following findings:

"(1) On February 24, 2022, the Government of the Russian Federation violated the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine by engaging in a premeditated, second illegal invasion of Ukraine.

"(2) The international community has condemned the illegal invasions of Ukraine by the Russian Federation, as well as the commission of the crime of aggression, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide by officials of the Russian Federation, including through the deliberate targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure, the forcible transfer of children, and the commission of sexual violence.

"(3) The leaders of the G7 have called the Russian Federation's 'unprovoked and completely unjustified attack on the democratic state of Ukraine' a 'serious violation of international law and a grave breach of the United Nations Charter and all commitments Russia entered in the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter of Paris and its commitments in the Budapest Memorandum'.

"(4) On March 2, 2022, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution ES–11/1, entitled 'Aggression against Ukraine', by a vote of 141 to 5. That resolution 'deplore[d] [probably should be "[d]eplore[d]"] in the strongest terms the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine in violation of Article 2(4) of the [United Nations] Charter' and demanded that the Russian Federation 'immediately cease its use of force against Ukraine' and 'immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders'.

"(5) On March 16, 2022, the International Court of Justice issued a provisional measures order requiring the Russian Federation to 'immediately suspend the military operations that it commenced on 24 February 2022 in the territory of Ukraine' and, in this regard, observed that 'orders on provisional measures . . . have binding effect'.

"(6) On November 14, 2022, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution [Resolution ES–11/5]—

"(A) recognizing that the Russian Federation has committed a serious breach of the most fundamental norms of international law and its gross and systematic refusal to obey its obligations has affected the entire international community;

"(B) recognizing the need for the establishment, in cooperation with Ukraine, of an international mechanism for compensation for financially assessable damages caused by the Russian Federation's internationally wrongful acts; and

"(C) recommending 'the creation . . . of an international register of damage to serve as a record . . . of evidence and claims information on damage, loss or injury to all natural and legal persons concerned, as well as the State of Ukraine, caused by internationally wrongful acts of the Russian Federation in or against Ukraine . . . . [sic]'.

"(7) The Russian Federation bears international legal responsibility for its aggression against Ukraine and, under international law, must cease its internationally wrongful acts. Because of this breach of the prohibition on aggression under international law, the United States is legally entitled to take counter measures that are proportionate and aimed at inducing the Russian Federation to comply with its international obligations.

"(8) Approximately $300,000,000,000 of Russian sovereign assets have been immobilized worldwide. Only a small fraction of those assets, 1 to 2 percent, or between $4,000,000,000 and $5,000,000,000, are reportedly subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.

"(9) The vast majority of immobilized Russian sovereign assets, approximately $190,000,000,000, are reportedly subject to the jurisdiction of Belgium. The Government of Belgium has publicly indicated that any action by that Government regarding those assets would be predicated on support by the G7.

"(b) Sense of Congress.—It is the sense of Congress that, having committed an act of aggression, as recognized by the United Nations General Assembly on March 2, 2022, the Russian Federation is to be considered as an aggressor state. The extreme illegal actions taken by the Russian Federation, including an act of aggression, present a unique situation, justifying the establishment of a legal authority for the United States Government and other countries to confiscate Russian sovereign assets in their respective jurisdictions.

#### "SEC. 102. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING IMPORTANCE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION PROVIDING COMPENSATION TO UKRAINE. ####

"It is the sense of Congress that—

"(1) the Russian Federation bears responsibility for the financial burden of the reconstruction of Ukraine and for countless other costs associated with the illegal invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation that began on February 24, 2022;

"(2) the most effective ways to provide compensation for the damages caused by the Russian Federation's internationally wrongful acts should be assessed by an international mechanism charged with determining compensation and providing assistance to Ukraine;

"(3) at least since November 2022 the Russian Federation has been on notice of its opportunity to comply with its international obligations, including to make full compensation for injury, or, by agreement with Ukraine, to authorize an international mechanism to resolve issues regarding compensation to Ukraine;

"(4) the Russian Federation can, by negotiated agreement, participate in any international process to assess the damages caused by the Russian Federation's internationally wrongful acts and make funds available to compensate for these damages, and if it fails to do so, the United States and other countries should explore all avenues for ensuring compensation to Ukraine;

"(5) the President should lead robust engagement on all bilateral and multilateral aspects of the response by the United States to acts by the Russian Federation that undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, including on any policy coordination and alignment regarding the repurposing or ordered transfer of Russian sovereign assets in the context of determining compensation and providing assistance to Ukraine;

"(6) as part of the robust engagement on bilateral and multilateral responses to acts by the Russian Federation that undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, the President should endeavor to facilitate creation of, and United States participation in, an international mechanism regarding the repurposing or seizure of sovereign assets of the Russian Federation for the benefit of Ukraine.[;]

"(7) the repurposing of Russian sovereign assets is in the national interests of the United States and consistent with United States and international law;

"(8) the United States should work with international allies and partners on the repurposing of Russian sovereign assets as part of a coordinated, multilateral effort, including with G7 countries and other countries in which Russian sovereign assets are located; and

"(9) any effort by the United States to confiscate and repurpose Russian sovereign assets should be undertaken alongside international allies and partners as part of a coordinated, multilateral effort, including with G7 countries, the European Union, Australia, and other countries in which Russian sovereign assets are located.

#### "SEC. 103. PROHIBITION ON RELEASE OF BLOCKED RUSSIAN SOVEREIGN ASSETS. ####

"(a) In General.—No Russian sovereign asset that is blocked or effectively immobilized by the Department of the Treasury before the date specified in section 104(j) [probably should be "section 104(l)"] may be released or mobilized, except as otherwise authorized by this division, until the date on which the President certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that—

"(2)(A) full compensation has been made to Ukraine for harms resulting from the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation; or

If such a joint resolution should be vetoed by the President, the time for debate in consideration of the veto message on such measure shall be limited to 20 hours in the Senate and in the House of Representatives shall be determined in accordance with the Rules of the House.

"(d) Cooperation on Prohibition of Release of Certain Russian Sovereign Assets.—Notwithstanding subsection (a), the President may take such actions as may be necessary to seek to obtain an agreement or arrangement to which the Government of Ukraine is party that discharges the Russian Federation from further obligations to compensate Ukraine.

Sec. 6. I hereby determine that, to the extent section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) may apply, the making of donations of the types of articles specified in such section by, to, or for the benefit of any sanctioned person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergencies declared in Executive Orders 13660 and 13694 [listed in a table under 50 U.S.C. 1701], and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by sections 1(a)(iv) and 3(a)(i) of this order.

Sec. 7. For the purposes of this order:

(a) the term "person" means an individual or entity;

(b) the term "entity" means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;

(c) the term "United States person" means any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person within the United States;

(d) the term "financial institution" includes: (i) a depository institution (as defined in section 3(c)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(c)(1))), including a branch or agency of a foreign bank (as defined in section 1(b)(7) of the International Banking Act of 1978 (12 U.S.C. 3101(7))); (ii) a credit union; (iii) a securities firm, including a broker or dealer; (iv) an insurance company, including an agency or underwriter; and (v) any other company that provides financial services;

(e) the term "international financial institution" has the meaning given that term in section 1701(c) of the International Financial Institutions Act (22 U.S.C. 262r(c));

(f) the term "United States financial institution" means a financial institution (including its foreign branches) organized under the laws of the United States or of any jurisdiction within the United States or located in the United States; and

(g) the term "sanctioned person" means a person that the President, or the Secretary of State or the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to authority delegated by the President and in accordance with the terms of such delegation, has determined is a person on whom sanctions shall be imposed pursuant to sections 224(a)(2), 224(a)(3), 231(a), 232(a), or 233(a) of CAATSA or sections 4(a) or 4(b) of UFSA and on whom the President, the Secretary of State, or the Secretary of the Treasury has imposed any of the sanctions in section 235 of CAATSA or section 4(c) of UFSA.

Sec. 8. For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken with respect to such property or interests in property pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergencies declared in Executive Orders 13660 and 13694, there need be no prior notice of an action taken pursuant to this order with respect to such property or interests in property.

Sec. 9. The unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens on whom sanctions described in sections 1(a)(iv) or 3(a)(i) of this order have been imposed would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and the entry of such persons into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, is hereby suspended. Such persons shall be treated as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693.

Sec. 10. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA, and sections 224(a)(2), 224(a)(3), 231(a), 231(e), 232(a), 233(a), and 235 of CAATSA and sections 4(a)–(c) and 4(h) of UFSA with respect to powers to impose sanctions, as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the Department of the Treasury. All departments and agencies of the United States Government shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order.

Sec. 11. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:

(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or

(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Donald J. Trump.
