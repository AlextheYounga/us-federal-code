#### Historical and Revision Notes ####

This section [section 23 of act May 24, 1949] inserts a new chapter 50 (secs. 1081–1083) in title 18, U.S.C., incorporating, with slight changes in phraseology, most of the provisions of act of April 27, 1948 (ch. 235, 62 Stat. 200), which was not incorporated in title 18 when the revision was enacted. Subsection (e) of section 1 of such act, defining "United States", when used in a geographical sense, was omitted as covered by section 5 of such title 18. Section 4 of such act, which provided that nothing in such act "shall be held to take away or impair the jurisdiction of the courts of the several States under the laws thereof, or to preclude action, otherwise valid, by any State or Territory with respect to the navigable waters within the boundaries of such State or Territory", was omitted as surplusage and unnecessary.
