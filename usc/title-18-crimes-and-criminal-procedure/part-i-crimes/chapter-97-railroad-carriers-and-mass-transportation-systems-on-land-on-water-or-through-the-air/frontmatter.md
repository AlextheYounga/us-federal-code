### **CHAPTER 97—RAILROAD CARRIERS AND MASS TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS ON LAND, ON WATER, OR THROUGH THE AIR** ###

Sec.

1991. Entering train to commit crime.

1992. Terrorist attacks and other violence against railroad carriers and against mass transportation systems on land, on water, or through the air.

#### Historical and Revision Notes ####

This chapter does not include motor busses, interstate trucking facilities or airplanes within the protection of existing law. Motor busses and trucks already carry a huge amount of interstate commerce. It is reasonable to presume that much interstate freight and express will soon be carried by air.

Attention is directed to the consideration of the extension of the laws now applicable only to railroads to these other interstate facilities. 80th Congress House Report No. 304.
