Reference to persons causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of “principal” in section 2 of this title.

#### Amendments ####

**1994**—Pub. L. 103–322, which directed the amendment of this section by substituting “fined under this title” for “fined not more than $2,000”, was executed by making the substitution for “fined not more than $3,000”, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.
