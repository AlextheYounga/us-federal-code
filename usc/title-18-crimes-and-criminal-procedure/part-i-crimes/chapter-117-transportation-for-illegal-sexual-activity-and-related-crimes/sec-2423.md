#### Historical and Revision Notes ####

Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §400 (June 25, 1910, ch. 395, §4, 36 Stat. 826).

Words "deemed guilty of a felony" were deleted as unnecessary in view of definition of felony in section 1 of this title. (See reviser's note under section 550 of this title.)

Words "and on conviction thereof shall be" were deleted as surplusage since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured.

Words "Possession of the United States" were inserted twice. (See reviser's note under section 2421 of this title.)

Minor changes were made in phraseology.

#### Sense of Congress ####

Pub. L. 118–31, div. E, title LI, §5102(b), Dec. 22, 2023, 137 Stat. 933, provided that: "The sense of Congress is the following:

"(1) The safety of children should be a top priority for public officials and communities in the United States.

"(2) According to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, an individual in the United States is sexually assaulted every 68 seconds. And every 9 minutes, that victim is a child. Meanwhile, only 25 out of every 1,000 perpetrators will end up in prison.

"(3) The effects of child sexual abuse can be long-lasting and affect the victim's mental health.

"(4) Victims are more likely than non-victims to experience the following mental health challenges:

"(A) Victims are about 4 times more likely to develop symptoms of drug abuse.

"(B) Victims are about 4 times more likely to experience post-traumatic stress disorder as adults.

"(C) Victims are about 3 times more likely to experience a major depressive episode as adults.

"(5) The criminal justice system should and has acted as an important line of defense to protect children and hold perpetrators accountable.

"(6) However, the horrific crimes perpetuated by Larry Nassar demonstrate firsthand the loopholes that still exist in the criminal justice system. While Larry Nassar was found guilty of several State-level offenses, he was not charged federally for his illicit sexual contact with minors, despite crossing State and international borders to commit this conduct.

"(7) The Department of Justice has also identified a growing trend of Americans who use charitable or missionary work in a foreign country as a cover for sexual abuse of children.

"(8) It is the intent of Congress to prohibit Americans from engaging in sexual abuse or exploitation of minors under the guise of work, including volunteer work, with an organization that affects interstate or foreign commerce, such as an international charity.

"(9) Federal law does not require that an abuser's intention to engage in sexual abuse be a primary, significant, dominant, or motivating purpose of the travel.

"(10) Child sexual abuse does not require physical contact between the abuser and the child. This is especially true as perpetrators turn increasingly to internet platforms, online chat rooms, and webcams to commit child sexual abuse.

"(11) However, a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit found the use of a webcam to engage in sexually provocative activity with a minor did not qualify as 'sexual activity'.

"(12) Congress can address this issue by amending the definition of the term 'sexual activity' to clarify that it does not require interpersonal, physical contact.

"(13) It is the duty of Congress to provide clearer guidance to ensure that those who commit crimes against children are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law."
