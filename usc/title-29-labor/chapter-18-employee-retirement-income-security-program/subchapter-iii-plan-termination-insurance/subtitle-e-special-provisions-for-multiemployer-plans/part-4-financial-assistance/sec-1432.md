#### (1) In general ####

The corporation may specify in regulations or guidance under subsection (c) that, during a period no longer than the first 2 years following March 11, 2021, applications may not be filed by an eligible multiemployer plan unless—

(A) the eligible multiemployer plan is insolvent or is likely to become insolvent within 5 years of March 11, 2021;

(D) the corporation determines it appropriate based on other similar circumstances.

#### (e) Actuarial assumptions ####

#### (1) Eligibility ####

For purposes of determining eligibility for special financial assistance, the corporation shall accept assumptions incorporated in a multiemployer plan's determination that it is in critical status or critical and declining status (within the meaning of section 1085(b) of this title) for certifications of plan status completed before January 1, 2021, unless such assumptions are clearly erroneous. For certifications of plan status completed after December 31, 2020, a plan shall determine whether it is in critical or critical and declining status for purposes of eligibility for special financial assistance by using the assumptions that the plan used in its most recently completed certification of plan status before January 1, 2021, unless such assumptions (excluding the plan's interest rate) are unreasonable.

#### (2) Amount of financial assistance ####

In determining the amount of special financial assistance in its application, an eligible multiemployer plan shall—

(A) use the interest rate used by the plan in its most recently completed certification of plan status before January 1, 2021, provided that such interest rate may not exceed the interest rate limit; and

(B) for other assumptions, use the assumptions that the plan used in its most recently completed certification of plan status before January 1, 2021, unless such assumptions are unreasonable.

#### (3) Interest rate limit ####

The interest rate limit for purposes of this subsection is the rate specified in section 1083(h)(2)(C)(iii) of this title (disregarding modifications made under clause (iv) of such section) for the month in which the application for special financial assistance is filed by the eligible multiemployer plan or the 3 preceding months, with such specified rate increased by 200 basis points.

#### (4) Changes in assumptions ####

If a plan determines that use of one or more prior assumptions is unreasonable, the plan may propose in its application to change such assumptions, provided that the plan discloses such changes in its application and describes why such assumptions are no longer reasonable. The corporation shall accept such changed assumptions unless it determines the changes are unreasonable, individually or in the aggregate. The plan may not propose a change to the interest rate otherwise required under this subsection for eligibility or financial assistance amount.

#### (f) Application deadline ####

Any application by a plan for special financial assistance under this section shall be submitted to the corporation (and, in the case of a plan to which section 432(k)(1)(D) of title 26 applies, to the Secretary of the Treasury) no later than December 31, 2025, and any revised application for special financial assistance shall be submitted no later than December 31, 2026.

#### (g) Determinations on applications ####

A plan's application for special financial assistance under this section that is timely filed in accordance with the regulations or guidance issued under subsection (c) shall be deemed approved unless the corporation notifies the plan within 120 days of the filing of the application that the application is incomplete, any proposed change or assumption is unreasonable, or the plan is not eligible under this section. Such notice shall specify the reasons the plan is ineligible for special financial assistance, any proposed change or assumption is unreasonable, or information is needed to complete the application. If a plan is denied assistance under this subsection, the plan may submit a revised application under this section. Any revised application for special financial assistance submitted by a plan shall be deemed approved unless the corporation notifies the plan within 120 days of the filing of the revised application that the application is incomplete, any proposed change or assumption is unreasonable, or the plan is not eligible under this section. Special financial assistance issued by the corporation shall be effective on a date determined by the corporation, but no later than 1 year after a plan's special financial assistance application is approved by the corporation or deemed approved. The corporation shall not pay any special financial assistance after September 30, 2030.

#### (h) Manner of payment ####

The payment made by the corporation to an eligible multiemployer plan under this section shall be made as a single, lump sum payment.

#### (i) Amount and manner of special financial assistance ####

#### (1) In general ####

Special financial assistance under this section shall be a transfer of funds in the amount necessary as demonstrated by the plan sponsor on the application for such special financial assistance, in accordance with the requirements described in subsection (j). Special financial assistance shall be paid to such plan as soon as practicable upon approval of the application by the corporation.

#### (2) No cap ####
