Title VII of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, comprising this subchapter, was originally added to Pub. L. 93–112 by Pub. L. 102–569, title VII, §701(2), Oct. 29, 1992, 106 Stat. 4443, and amended by Pub. L. 103–73, Aug. 11, 1993, 107 Stat. 718. Title VII is shown herein, however, as having been added by Pub. L. 105–220, title IV, §410, Aug. 7, 1998, 112 Stat. 1217, without reference to those intervening amendments because of the extensive revision of title VII by Pub. L. 105–220.
