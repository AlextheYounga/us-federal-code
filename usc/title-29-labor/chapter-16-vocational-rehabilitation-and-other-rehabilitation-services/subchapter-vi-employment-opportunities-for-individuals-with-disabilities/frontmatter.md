Pub. L. 113–128, title IV, §461(1), (2), July 22, 2014, 128 Stat. 1679, amended this subchapter by striking out part A, consisting of sections 795 and 795a, and striking out the heading of part B preceding section 795g.

Title VI of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, comprising this subchapter, was originally added to Pub. L. 93–112 by Pub. L. 95–602, title II, §201, Nov. 6, 1978, 92 Stat. 2989, and amended by Pub. L. 98–221, Feb. 22, 1984, 98 Stat. 17; Pub. L. 99–506, Oct. 21, 1986, 100 Stat. 1807; Pub. L. 100–630, Nov. 7, 1988, 102 Stat. 3289; Pub. L. 102–52, June 6, 1991, 105 Stat. 260; Pub. L. 102–119, Oct. 7, 1991, 105 Stat. 587; Pub. L. 102–569, Oct. 29, 1992, 106 Stat. 4344; Pub. L. 103–73, Aug. 11, 1993, 107 Stat. 718. Title VI is shown herein, however, as having been added by Pub. L. 105–220, title IV, §409, Aug. 7, 1998, 112 Stat. 1210, without reference to those intervening amendments because of the extensive revision of title VI by Pub. L. 105–220.
