|          70909           |      36:288.       |Aug. 30, 1950, ch. 823, §18, 64 Stat. 567.|

The words "Secretary of Education" and "Secretary" are substituted for "United States Commissioner of Education", "Commissioner of Education", and "Commissioner", and the words "Department of Education" are substituted for "Office of Education", in section 18 of the Act of August 30, 1950 (ch. 823, 64 Stat. 567), because of 20:3441 and 3507. The words "with the approval of the Federal Security Administrator" and "with the approval of the Administrator" are omitted because the functions of the Federal Security Administrator were transferred to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare by section 5 of Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1953 (5 App. U.S.C.), and were subsequently transferred to the Secretary of Education by 20:3441. See also 20:3507. Substitution of a reference to the "Secretary of Education" would result in a requirement of the Secretary's own approval. The word "activities" (the first time it appears) is substituted for "business and activities" for consistency in the revised title.
