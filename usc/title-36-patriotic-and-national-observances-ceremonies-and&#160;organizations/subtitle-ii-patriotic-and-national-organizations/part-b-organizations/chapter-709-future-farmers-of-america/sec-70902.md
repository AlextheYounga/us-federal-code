In clause (1), the reference to the Vocational Education Act of 1946 (ch. 541, 49 Stat. 1488) is omitted because that Act was repealed by section 103 of the Act of October 16, 1968 (Public Law 90–576, 82 Stat. 1091). The words "States, territories, and possessions" are substituted for "several States and Territories" for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.

In clause (7), the words "young men and women" are substituted for "farm boys and young men" to use gender-neutral terminology.
