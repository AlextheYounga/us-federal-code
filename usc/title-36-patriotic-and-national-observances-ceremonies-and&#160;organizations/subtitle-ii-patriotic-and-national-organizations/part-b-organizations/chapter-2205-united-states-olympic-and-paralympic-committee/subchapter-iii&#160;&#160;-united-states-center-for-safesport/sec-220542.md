(D) a requirement that the Center, including any officer, agent, attorney, or staff member of the Center, shall not take any action to notify an alleged perpetrator of abuse of an amateur athlete of any ongoing investigation or accusation unless—

(ii) any other report relating to abuse of any amateur athlete, including emotional, physical, and sexual abuse;

(I) a mechanism by which a national governing body can—

(i) share confidentially a report of suspected child abuse of an amateur athlete who is a minor by a member of a national governing body or an adult authorized by a national governing body or an amateur sports organization to interact with an amateur athlete who is a minor, with the Center, which in turn, may share with relevant national governing bodies and other entities; and

(J) a prohibition on the use in a decision of the Center under section 220541(a)(1)(D) of any evidence relating to other sexual behavior or the sexual predisposition of the alleged victim, or the admission of any such evidence in arbitration, unless the probative value of the use or admission of such evidence, as determined by the Center or the arbitrator, as applicable, substantially outweighs the danger of—

(i) any harm to the alleged victim; and

(ii) unfair prejudice to any party; and

(K) training for investigators on appropriate methods and techniques for ensuring sensitivity toward alleged victims during interviews and other investigative activities.

(b) Rule of Construction.—Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ability of a national governing body to impose an interim measure to prevent an individual who is the subject of an allegation of sexual abuse from interacting with an amateur athlete prior to the Center exercising its jurisdiction over a matter.
