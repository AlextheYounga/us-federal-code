(Aug. 10, 1956, ch. 1041, 70A Stat. 550, §8918; renumbered §9318 and amended Pub. L. 115–232, div. A, title VIII, §§806(b)(13), 809(a), Aug. 13, 2018, 132 Stat. 1833, 1840.)

|      8918       |      10:943.       |R.S. 1243; Dec. 16, 1930, ch. 14, §1 (as applicable to R.S. 1243), 46 Stat. 1028.|

The word "commissioned" is inserted, since the retirement of warrant officers for length of service is covered by section 1293 of this title. The word "regular" is inserted, since 10:943 is applicable historically only to officers of a regular component. The words "and placed on the retired list" are omitted as surplusage. The words "computed under section 8926 of this title" are inserted for clarity.
