Section 14201 of this title, referred to in subsec. (a)(2), probably should be section 14101 of this title, which relates to convening of selection boards. There is no section 14201 of this title.

Section 14502(b) of this title, referred to in subsec. (d)(1), probably should be section 14501(b) of this title, which relates to officers twice failed of selection. Section 14502(b) of this title relates to officers considered but not selected due to material error.
