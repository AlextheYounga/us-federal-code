Pub. L. 117–81, div. A, title V, §§535, 539C, Dec. 27, 2021, 135 Stat. 1696, 1699, provided that, effective on the date that is two years after Dec. 27, 2021, and applicable with respect to offenses that occur after that date, with provisions for delayed effect and applicability, this section is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:

*(e) For each general and special court-martial for which charges and specifications were referred by a special trial counsel—*

*(1) a special trial counsel shall be detailed as trial counsel; and*

*(2) a special trial counsel may detail other trial counsel as necessary who are judge advocates.*

See 2021 Amendment note below.

|  *Revised section*   |     *Source (U.S. Code)*     |          *Source (Statutes at Large)*           |
|----------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|827(a)<br/><br/>827(b)|50:591(a).<br/><br/>50:591(b).|May 5, 1950, ch. 169, §1 (Art. 27), 64 Stat. 117.|
|        827(c)        |          50:591(c).          |                                                 |

The words, "detail" and "detailed" are substituted for the words "appoint" and "appointed" throughout the revised section, since the filling of the position involved is not appointment to an office in the constitutional sense.

In subsection (a), the word "and" is substituted for the words "together with". The word "considers" is substituted for the word "deems". The words "necessary or" are omitted as surplusage, since what is necessary is also appropriate. The word "may" is substituted for the word "shall". The word "later" is substituted for the word "subsequently".

In subsections (b) and (c), the word "must" is substituted for the word "shall", since the clauses prescribe conditions and not commands.

In subsection (b), the word "for" is substituted for the words "in the case of". The words "person \* \* \* a person who is" are omitted as surplusage.
