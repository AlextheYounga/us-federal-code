The word "a" is substituted for the word "every". The word "by" before the words "any officer" is omitted as surplusage. The word "person" is substituted for the word "officer" before the words "who convened", since, under sections 823 and 824 of this title (articles 23 and 24), noncommissioned officers who are "officers in charge" may convene special and summary courts-martial.
