In subsection (a), the word "detail" is substituted for the word "appoint", since the filling of the position involved is not appointment to an office in the constitutional sense. The word "commissioned" is inserted for clarity. The word "are" is substituted for the words "shall be". The words "the provisions of" are omitted as surplusage.

In subsections (b) and (c), the word "shall" is substituted for the words "It shall be the duty of \* \* \* to".

In subsection (c)(3), the word "sent" is substituted for the word "transmitted".

In subsection (d), the word "has" is substituted for the words "shall have".
