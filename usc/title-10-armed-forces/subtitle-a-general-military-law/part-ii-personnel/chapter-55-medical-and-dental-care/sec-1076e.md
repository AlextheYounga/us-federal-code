(a) Eligibility.—(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), a member of the Retired Reserve of a reserve component of the armed forces who is qualified for a non-regular retirement at age 60 under chapter 1223 of this title, but is not age 60, is eligible for health benefits under TRICARE Retired Reserve as provided in this section.

If a member of a reserve component dies while in a period of coverage under this section, the eligibility of the members of the immediate family of such member for TRICARE Retired Reserve coverage under this section shall continue for the same period of time that would be provided under section 1086 of this title if the member had been eligible at the time of death for TRICARE Retired Reserve coverage under such section (instead of under this section).

Such premium shall apply instead of any enrollment fees required under section 1075 of this section.<sup><a href="#1076e_2_target" name="1076e_2">2</a></sup>

(3) The monthly amount of the premium in effect for a month for TRICARE Retired Reserve coverage under this section shall be the amount equal to the cost of coverage that the Secretary determines on an appropriate actuarial basis.

(4) The Secretary shall prescribe the requirements and procedures applicable to the payment of premiums under this subsection.

(5) Amounts collected as premiums under this subsection shall be credited to the appropriation available for the Defense Health Program Account under section 1100 of this title, shall be merged with sums in such Account that are available for the fiscal year in which collected, and shall be available under subsection (b) of such section for such fiscal year.

(e) Regulations.—The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the other administering Secretaries, shall prescribe regulations for the administration of this section.

(f) Definitions.—In this section:

(1) The term "immediate family", with respect to a member of a reserve component, means all of the member's dependents described in subparagraphs (A), (D), and (I) of section 1072(2) of this title.

(2) The term "TRICARE Retired Reserve" means the TRICARE Select self-managed, preferred-provider network option under section 1075 made available to beneficiaries by reason of this section and in accordance with subsection (d)(1).
