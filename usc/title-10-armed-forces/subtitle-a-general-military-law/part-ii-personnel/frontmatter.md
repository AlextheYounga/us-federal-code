"(i) for reasons other than a substantiated violation of the policy required by subsection (a); or

"(ii) under other provisions of law or regulation.

"(3) Substantiated violation.—For purposes of paragraph (1), a violation by a member of the Armed Forces described in subsection (a)(2)(A) of the policy required by subsection (a) shall be treated as substantiated if—
