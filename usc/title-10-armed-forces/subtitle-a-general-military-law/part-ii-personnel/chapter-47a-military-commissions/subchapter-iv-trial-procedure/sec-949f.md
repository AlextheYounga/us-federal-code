Challenges by trial counsel shall ordinarily be presented and decided before those by the accused are offered.

(b) Peremptory Challenges.—The accused and trial counsel are each entitled to one peremptory challenge, but the military judge may not be challenged except for cause.

(c) Challenges Against Additional Members.—Whenever additional members are detailed to a military commission under this chapter, and after any challenges for cause against such additional members are presented and decided, the accused and trial counsel are each entitled to one peremptory challenge against members not previously subject to peremptory challenge.
