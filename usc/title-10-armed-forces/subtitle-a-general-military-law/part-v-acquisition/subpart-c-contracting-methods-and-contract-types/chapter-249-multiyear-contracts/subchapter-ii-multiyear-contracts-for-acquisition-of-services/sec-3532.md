### §3532. Multiyear contracts for acquisition of services: applicable principles ###

In entering into multiyear contracts for services under the authority of this subchapter, the head of the agency shall be guided by the following principles:

(1) The portion of the cost of any plant or equipment amortized as a cost of contract performance should not exceed the ratio between the period of contract performance and the anticipated useful commercial life of such plant or equipment. Useful commercial life, for this purpose, means the commercial utility of the facilities rather than the physical life thereof, with due consideration given to such factors as location of facilities, specialized nature thereof, and obsolescence.

(2) Consideration shall be given to the desirability of obtaining an option to renew the contract for a reasonable period not to exceed three years, at prices not to include charges for plant, equipment and other nonrecurring costs, already amortized.

(3) Consideration shall be given to the desirability of reserving in the agency the right, upon payment of the unamortized portion of the cost of the plant or equipment, to take title thereto under appropriate circumstances.

(Added and amended Pub. L. 116–283, div. A, title XVIII, §1822(m), (o), Jan. 1, 2021, 134 Stat. 4203.)
