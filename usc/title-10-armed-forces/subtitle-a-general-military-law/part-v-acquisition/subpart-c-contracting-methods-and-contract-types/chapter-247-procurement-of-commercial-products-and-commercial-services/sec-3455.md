(2) the contracting officer determines in writing that the subsystem is a commercial product.

(c) Treatment of Components and Spare Parts as Commercial Products.—(1) A component or spare part for a major weapon system (other than a commercially available off-the-shelf item as defined in section 104 of title 41) may be treated as a commercial product for the purposes of chapter 271 of this title if either—

(A) prices paid for the same or similar commercial products under comparable terms and conditions by both Government and commercial customers;

(B) if the contracting officer determines that the offeror does not have access to and cannot provide sufficient information described in subparagraph (A) to determine the reasonableness of price, information on—

(i) prices for the same or similar items sold under different terms and conditions;

(ii) prices for similar levels of work or effort on related products or services;

(iii) prices for alternative solutions or approaches; and

(iv) other relevant information that can serve as the basis for a price assessment; and

(C) if the contracting officer determines that the information submitted pursuant to subparagraphs (A) and (B) is not sufficient to determine the reasonableness of price, other relevant information regarding the basis for price or cost, including information on labor costs, material costs, and overhead rates.

(2) An offeror may submit information or analysis relating to the value of a commercial product to aid in the determination of the reasonableness of the price of such item.

(3) An offeror may not be required to submit information described in paragraph (1)(C) with regard to a commercially available off-the-shelf item and may be required to submit such information with regard to any other item that was developed exclusively at private expense only after the head of the contracting activity determines in writing that the information submitted pursuant to paragraphs (1)(A) and (1)(B) is not sufficient to determine the reasonableness of price.
