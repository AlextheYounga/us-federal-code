#### Inclusion of Best Available Information Regarding Past Performance of Subcontractors and Joint Venture Partners ####

Pub. L. 115–232, div. A, title VIII, §823, Aug. 13, 2018, 132 Stat. 1855, provided that: "Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act [Aug. 13, 2018], the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council and the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, shall develop policies for the Department of Defense to ensure the best information regarding past performance of certain subcontractors and joint venture partners is available when awarding Department of Defense contracts. The policies shall include proposed revisions to the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement as follows:

"(1) Required performance evaluations, as part of a government-wide evaluation reporting tool, for first-tier subcontractors on construction and architect-engineer contracts performing a portion of the contract valued at the threshold set forth in section 42.1502(e) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, or 20 percent of the value of the prime contract, whichever is higher, provided—

"(A) the information included in rating the subcontractor is not inconsistent with the information included in the rating for the prime contractor;

"(B) the subcontractor evaluation is conducted consistent with the provisions of section 42.15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation;

"(C) negative evaluations of a subcontractor in no way obviate the prime contractor's responsibility for successful completion of the contract and management of its subcontractors; and

"(D) that in the judgment of the contracting officer, the overall execution of the work is impacted by the performance of the subcontractor or subcontractors.

"(2) Required performance evaluations, as part of a government-wide evaluation reporting tool, of individual partners of joint venture-awarded construction and architect-engineer contracts valued at the threshold set forth in section 42.1502(e) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, to ensure that past performance on joint venture projects is considered in future awards to individual joint venture partners, provided—

"(A) at a minimum, the rating for joint ventures includes an identification that allows the evaluation to be retrieved for each partner of the joint venture;

"(B) each partner, through the joint venture, is given the same opportunity to submit comments, rebutting statements, or additional information, consistent with the provisions of section 42.15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation; and

"(C) the rating clearly identifies the responsibilities of joint venture partners for discrete elements of the work where the partners are not jointly and severally responsible for the project.

"(3) Processes to request exceptions from the annual evaluation requirement under section 42.1502(a) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation for construction and architect-engineer contracts where submission of the annual evaluations would not provide the best representation of the performance of a contractor, including subcontractors and joint venture partners, including—

"(A) where no severable element of the work has been completed;

"(B) where the contracting officer determines that—

"(i) an insubstantial portion of the contract work has been completed in the preceding year; and

"(ii) the lack of performance is at no fault to the contractor; or

"(C) where the contracting officer determines that there is an issue in dispute which, until resolved, would likely cause the annual rating to inaccurately reflect the past performance of the contractor."

#### Inclusion of Data on Contractor Performance in Past Performance Databases for Source Selection Decisions ####

Pub. L. 112–81, div. A, title VIII, §806, Dec. 31, 2011, 125 Stat. 1487, as amended by Pub. L. 112–239, div. A, title X, §1076(a)(11), Jan. 2, 2013, 126 Stat. 1948; Pub. L. 116–92, div. A, title IX, §902(35), Dec. 20, 2019, 133 Stat. 1547, provided that:

"(b) Elements.—The strategy required by subsection (a) shall, at a minimum—

"(1) establish standards for the timeliness and completeness of past performance submissions for purposes of databases described in subsection (a);

"(2) assign responsibility and management accountability for the completeness of past performance submissions for such purposes; and

"(3) ensure that past performance submissions for such purposes are consistent with award fee evaluations in cases where such evaluations have been conducted.

"(c) Contractor Comments.—Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act [Dec. 31, 2011], the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment shall revise the Defense Supplement to the Federal Acquisition Regulation to require the following:

"(1) That affected contractors are provided, in a timely manner, information on contractor performance to be included in past performance databases in accordance with subsection (a).

"(2) That such contractors are afforded up to 14 calendar days, from the date of delivery of the information provided in accordance with paragraph (1), to submit comments, rebuttals, or additional information pertaining to past performance for inclusion in such databases.

"(3) That agency evaluations of contractor past performance, including any information submitted under paragraph (2), are included in the relevant past performance database not later than the date that is 14 days after the date of delivery of the information provided in accordance with paragraph (1).

"(d) Construction.—Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a contractor from submitting comments, rebuttals, or additional information pertaining to past performance after the period described in subsection (c)(2) has elapsed or to prohibit a contractor from challenging a past performance evaluation in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, or procedures.

"(e) Comptroller General Report.—Not later than 18 months after the date of the enactment of this Act [Dec. 31, 2011], the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit to the congressional defense committees [Committees on Armed Services and Appropriations of the Senate and the House of Representatives] a report on the actions taken by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment pursuant to this section, including an assessment of the extent to which such actions have achieved the objectives of this section."
