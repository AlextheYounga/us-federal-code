Pub. L. 116–283, div. A, title XVIII, §1818(c), Jan. 1, 2021, 134 Stat. 4188, initially transferred section 2302e of this title to this section, to become effective Jan. 1, 2022. Pub. L. 117–81, div. A, title XVII, §1701(v)(1)(A), Dec. 27, 2021, 135 Stat. 2154, repealed section 1818(c) of Pub. L. 116–283, effective as if included therein, which eliminated that transfer, thereby omitting this section before it took effect. Another amendment by Pub. L. 117–81 resulted in the transfer of section 2302e to section 4004 of this title.
