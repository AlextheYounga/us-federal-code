(1) A process for streamlined communications between the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the acquisition community, and the research and development community, including—

(A) a process for the commanders of the combatant commands and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to communicate their needs to the acquisition community and the research and development community; and

(B) a process for the acquisition community and the research and development community to propose capabilities that meet the needs communicated by the combatant commands and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

(2) Procedures for demonstrating, rapidly acquiring, and deploying a capability proposed pursuant to paragraph (1)(B), including—

(A) a process for demonstrating and evaluating for current operational purposes the performance of the capability;

(B) a process for developing an acquisition and funding strategy for the deployment of the capability; and

(C) a process for making deployment and utilization determinations based on information obtained pursuant to subparagraphs (A) and (B).

(4) Specific procedures in accordance with the guidance developed under section 804(a) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (Public Law 114–92; 10 U.S.C. 3201 note prec.).

(c) Response to Combat Emergencies and Certain Urgent Operational Needs.—

(1) Determination of need for urgent acquisition and deployment.—(A) In the case of any capability that, as determined in writing by the Secretary of Defense, is urgently needed to eliminate a documented deficiency that has resulted in combat casualties, or is likely to result in combat casualties, the Secretary may use the procedures developed under this section in order to accomplish the urgent acquisition and deployment of the needed capability.

(B) In the case of any capability that, as determined in writing by the Secretary of Defense, is urgently needed to eliminate a documented deficiency that impacts an ongoing or anticipated contingency operation and that, if left unfulfilled, could potentially result in loss of life or critical mission failure, the Secretary may use the procedures developed under this section in order to accomplish the urgent acquisition and deployment of the needed capability.

(C)(i) In the case of any cyber capability that, as determined in writing by the Secretary of Defense, is urgently needed to eliminate a deficiency that as the result of a cyber attack has resulted in critical mission failure, the loss of life, property destruction, or economic effects, or if left unfilled is likely to result in critical mission failure, the loss of life, property destruction, or economic effects, the Secretary may use the procedures developed under this section in order to accomplish the urgent acquisition and deployment of the needed offensive or defensive cyber capability.

(ii) In this subparagraph, the term "cyber attack" means a deliberate action to alter, disrupt, deceive, degrade, or destroy computer systems or networks or the information or programs resident in or transiting these systems or networks.
