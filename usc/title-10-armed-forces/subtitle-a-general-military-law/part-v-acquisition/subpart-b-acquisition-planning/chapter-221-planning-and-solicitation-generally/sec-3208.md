### §3208. Planning for future competition in contracts for major systems ###

(a) Development Contract.—

(1) Determining whether proposals are necessary.—The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that, in preparing a solicitation for the award of a development contract for a major system, the head of an agency consider requiring in the solicitation that an offeror include in its offer proposals described in paragraph (2). In determining whether to require such proposals, the head of the agency shall give due consideration to the purposes for which the system is being procured and the technology necessary to meet the system's required capabilities. If such proposals are required, the head of the agency shall consider them in evaluating the offeror's price.

(2) Contents of proposals.—Proposals referred to in the first sentence of paragraph (1) are the following:

(A) Proposals to incorporate in the design of the major system items which are currently available within the supply system of the Federal agency responsible for the major system, available elsewhere in the national supply system, or commercially available from more than one source.

(B) With respect to items that are likely to be required in substantial quantities during the system's service life, proposals to incorporate in the design of the major system items which the United States will be able to acquire competitively in the future.

(b) Production Contract.—

(1) Determining whether proposals are necessary.—The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that, in preparing a solicitation for the award of a production contract for a major system, the head of an agency consider requiring in the solicitation that an offeror include in its offer proposals described in paragraph (2). In determining whether to require such proposals, the head of the agency shall give due consideration to the purposes for which the system is being procured and the technology necessary to meet the system's required capabilities. If such proposals are required, the head of the agency shall consider them in evaluating the offeror's price.

(2) Contents of proposals.—Proposals referred to in the first sentence of paragraph (1) are proposals identifying opportunities to ensure that the United States will be able to obtain on a competitive basis items procured in connection with the system that are likely to be reprocured in substantial quantities during the service life of the system. Proposals submitted in response to such requirement may include the following:

(A) Proposals to provide to the United States the right to use technical data to be provided under the contract for competitive reprocurement of the item, together with the cost to the United States, if any, of acquiring such technical data and the right to use such data.

(B) Proposals for the qualification or development of multiple sources of supply for the item.

(c) Consideration of Factors as Objectives in Negotiations.—If the head of an agency is making a noncompetitive award of a development contract or a production contract for a major system, the factors specified in subsections (a) and (b) to be considered in evaluating an offer for a contract may be considered as objectives in negotiating the contract to be awarded. Such objectives may not impair the rights of prospective contractors or subcontractors otherwise provided by law.

(d) Items Developed Exclusively at Private Expense.—

(1) Limitation.—Whenever the head of an agency requires that proposals described in subsection (a)(2) or (b)(2) be submitted by an offeror in its offer, the offeror shall not be required to provide a proposal that enables the United States to acquire competitively in the future an identical item if the item was developed exclusively at private expense unless the head of the agency determines that—

(A) the original supplier of such item will be unable to satisfy program schedule or delivery requirements; or

(B) proposals by the original supplier of such item to meet the mobilization requirements are insufficient to meet the agency's mobilization needs.

(2) Evaluation.—In considering offers in response to a solicitation requiring proposals described in subsection (a)(2) or (b)(2), the head of an agency shall base any evaluation of items developed exclusively at private expense on an analysis of the total value, in terms of innovative design, life-cycle costs, and other pertinent factors, of incorporating such items in the system.
