### §3205. Simplified procedures for small purchases ###

(a) Authorization.—In order to promote efficiency and economy in contracting and to avoid unnecessary burdens for agencies and contractors, the Federal Acquisition Regulation shall provide for—

(1) special simplified procedures for purchases of property and services for amounts not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold; and

(2) special simplified procedures for purchases of property and services for amounts greater than the simplified acquisition threshold but not greater than $5,000,000 with respect to which the contracting officer reasonably expects, based on the nature of the property or services sought and on market research, that offers will include only commercial products or commercial services.

(b) Prohibition on Dividing Contracts.—A proposed purchase or contract for an amount above the simplified acquisition threshold may not be divided into several purchases or contracts for lesser amounts in order to use the simplified procedures required by subsection (a).

(c) Promotion of Competition.—In using simplified procedures, the head of an agency shall promote competition to the maximum extent practicable.

(d) Compliance With Special Requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation.—The head of an agency shall comply with the Federal Acquisition Regulation provisions referred to in section 1901(e) of title 41.
