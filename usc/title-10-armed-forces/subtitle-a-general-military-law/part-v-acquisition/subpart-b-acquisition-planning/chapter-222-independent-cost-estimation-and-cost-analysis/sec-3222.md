(1) for the technology maturation and risk reduction phase, includes the identification and sensitivity analysis of key cost drivers that may affect life-cycle costs of the program or subprogram; and

(2) for the engineering and manufacturing development phase, or production and deployment phase, includes a cost estimate of the full life-cycle cost of the program or subprogram.

(b) Regulations.—The regulations governing the content and submission of independent cost estimates required by section 3221 of this title shall require that the independent cost estimate of the full life-cycle cost of a program or subprogram include—

(1) all costs of development, procurement, military construction, operations and support, and trained manpower to operate, maintain, and support the program or subprogram upon full operational deployment, without regard to funding source or management control; and
