### §4252. Major defense acquisition programs: certification required before Milestone B approval ###

(a) Certifications and Determination Required.—A major defense acquisition program may not receive Milestone B approval until the milestone decision authority—

(4) in the case of a space system, performs a cost benefit analysis for any new or follow-on satellite system using a dedicated ground control system instead of a shared ground control system, except that no cost benefit analysis is required to be performed under this paragraph for any Milestone B approval of a space system after December 31, 2019; and

(5) in the case of a naval vessel program, certifies compliance with the requirements of section 8669b of this title.

(b) Changes to Certifications or Determination.—(1) The program manager for a major defense acquisition program that has received certifications or a determination under subsection (a) shall immediately notify the milestone decision authority of any changes to the program or a designated major subprogram of such program that—

(A) alter the substantive basis for the certifications or determination of the milestone decision authority relating to any component of such certifications or determination specified in paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of subsection (a); or

(B) otherwise cause the program or subprogram to deviate significantly from the material provided to the milestone decision authority in support of such certifications or determination.

(2) Upon receipt of information under paragraph (1), the milestone decision authority may withdraw the certifications or determination concerned or rescind Milestone B approval if the milestone decision authority determines that such certifications, determination, or approval are no longer valid.

(c) Submissions to Congress on Milestone B.—

(1) Brief summary report.—Not later than 15 days after granting Milestone B approval for a major defense acquisition program, the milestone decision authority for the program shall provide to the congressional defense committees and, in the case of intelligence or intelligence-related activities, the congressional intelligence committees a brief summary report that contains the following elements:

(A) The program cost and fielding targets established under section 4271(a) of this title.

(B) The estimated cost and schedule for the program established by the military department concerned, including—

(i) the dollar values estimated for the program acquisition unit cost, average procurement unit cost, and total life-cycle cost; and

(ii) the planned dates for each program milestone, initial operational test and evaluation, and initial operational capability.

(C) The independent estimated cost for the program established pursuant to section 3221(b)(6) of this title, and any independent estimated schedule for the program, including—

(i) the dollar values and ranges estimated for the program acquisition unit cost, average procurement unit cost, and total life-cycle cost; and

(ii) the planned dates for each program milestone, initial operational test and evaluation, and initial operational capability.

(D) A summary of the technical and manufacturing risks associated with the program, as determined by the military department concerned, including identification of any critical technologies or manufacturing processes that have not been successfully demonstrated in a relevant environment.

(E) A summary of the independent technical risk assessment conducted or approved under section 4272 of this title, including identification of any critical technologies or manufacturing processes that have not been successfully demonstrated in a relevant environment.
