(a) Limitation on Prototype Project Duration.—A prototype project shall be completed within two years of its initiation.

(b) Merit-based Selection Process.—A prototype project shall be selected by the service acquisition executive of the military department concerned through a merit-based selection process that identifies the most promising, innovative, and cost-effective prototypes that address one or more of the elements set forth in subsection (c)(1) of section 4422 of this title and are expected to be successfully demonstrated in a relevant environment.

(c) Type of Transaction.—Prototype projects shall be funded through contracts, cooperative agreements, or other transactions.

(d) Funding Limit.—(1) Each prototype project may not exceed a total amount of $10,000,000 (based on fiscal year 2017 constant dollars), unless—

(A) the Secretary of the military department, or the Secretary's designee, approves a larger amount of funding for the project, not to exceed $50,000,000; and

(B) the Secretary, or the Secretary's designee, submits to the congressional defense committees, within 30 days after approval of such funding for the project, a notification that includes—

#### **Editorial Notes** ####

#### References in Text ####

Section 4003, referred to in subsec. (e), probably should be a reference to section 4022 of this title. Pub. L. 116–283, div. A, title XVIII, §1841(b)(1), Jan. 1, 2021, 134 Stat. 4243, initially transferred section 2371b of this title to section 4003, to become effective Jan. 1, 2022. However, Pub. L. 117–81, div. A, title XVII, §1701(u)(2)(B), Dec. 27, 2021, 135 Stat. 2151, amended section 1841(b)(1) of Pub. L. 116–283, effective as if included therein, so as to eliminate the transfer to section 4003 and instead transfer section 2371b to section 4022 of this title.

#### Amendments ####
