#### Acquisition Strategies To Ensure Competition Throughout the Lifecycle of Major Defense Acquisition Programs ####

Pub. L. 111–23, title II, §202, May 22, 2009, 123 Stat. 1720, as amended by Pub. L. 112–81, div. A, title VIII, §837, Dec. 31, 2011, 125 Stat. 1509; Pub. L. 112–239, div. A, title VIII, §825, Jan. 2, 2013, 126 Stat. 1833, provided that:

"(a) Acquisition Strategies To Ensure Competition.—The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that the acquisition strategy for each major defense acquisition program includes—

"(1) measures to ensure competition, or the option of competition, at both the prime contract level and the subcontract level (at such tier or tiers as are appropriate) of such program throughout the life-cycle of such program as a means to improve contractor performance; and

"(2) adequate documentation of the rationale for the selection of the subcontract tier or tiers under paragraph (1).

"(b) Measures To Ensure Competition.—The measures to ensure competition, or the option of competition, for purposes of subsection (a)(1) may include measures to achieve the following, in appropriate cases if such measures are cost-effective:

"(1) Competitive prototyping.

"(2) Dual-sourcing.

"(3) Unbundling of contracts.

"(4) Funding of next-generation prototype systems or subsystems.

"(5) Use of modular, open architectures to enable competition for upgrades.

"(6) Use of build-to-print approaches to enable production through multiple sources.

"(7) Acquisition of complete technical data packages.

"(8) Periodic competitions for subsystem upgrades.

"(9) Licensing of additional suppliers.

"(10) Periodic system or program reviews to address long-term competitive effects of program decisions.

"(c) Additional Measures To Ensure Competition at Subcontract Level.—The Secretary shall take actions to ensure competition or the option of competition at the subcontract level on major defense acquisition programs by—

"(1) where appropriate, breaking out a major subsystem, conducting a separate competition for the subsystem, and providing the subsystem to the prime contractor as Government-furnished equipment;

"(2) requiring prime contractors to give full and fair consideration to qualified sources other than the prime contractor for the development or construction of major subsystems and components of major weapon systems;

"(3) providing for government surveillance of the process by which prime contractors consider such sources and determine whether to conduct such development or construction in-house or through a subcontract; and

"(4) providing for the assessment of the extent to which a contractor has given full and fair consideration to qualified sources other than the contractor in sourcing decisions as a part of past performance evaluations.

"(d) Consideration of Competition Throughout Maintenance and Sustainment of Major Weapon Systems and Subsystems.—Whenever a decision regarding source of repair results in a plan to award a contract for performance of maintenance and sustainment of a major weapon system or subsystem of a major weapon system, the Secretary shall take actions to ensure that, to the maximum extent practicable and consistent with statutory requirements, contracts for such maintenance and sustainment, or for components needed for such maintenance and sustainment, are awarded on a competitive basis and give full consideration to all sources (including sources that partner or subcontract with public or private sector repair activities).

"(e) Applicability.—

"(1) Strategy and measures to ensure competition.—The requirements of subsections (a) and (b) shall apply to any acquisition plan for a major defense acquisition program that is developed or revised on or after the date that is 60 days after the date of the enactment of this Act [May 22, 2009].

"(2) Additional actions.—The actions required by subsections (c) and (d) shall be taken within 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act."
