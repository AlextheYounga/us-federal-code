(3) Offeror for subcontract.—An offeror for a subcontract (at any tier) of a contract under this chapter shall be required to submit cost or pricing data before the award of the subcontract if the prime contractor and each higher-tier subcontractor have been required to make available cost or pricing data under this chapter and the price of the subcontract is expected to exceed $2,000,000.
