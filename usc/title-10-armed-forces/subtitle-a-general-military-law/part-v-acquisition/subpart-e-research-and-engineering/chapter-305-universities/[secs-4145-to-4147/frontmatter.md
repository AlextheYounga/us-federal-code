#### **Editorial Notes** ####

#### Codification ####

Sections 4145 to 4147 were initially transferred from sections 2350l, 2368, and 2367 of this title, respectively, by Pub. L. 116–283, div. A, title XVIII, §1844(b), Jan. 1, 2021, 134 Stat. 4246, to become effective Jan. 1, 2022. However, Pub. L. 117–81, div. A, title XVII, §1701(u)(5)(B), Dec. 27, 2021, 135 Stat. 2154, struck out and added a new section 1844(b) of Pub. L. 116–283, effective as if included therein. The new section 1844(b) did not direct any transfers to sections 4145 to 4147, thereby omitting these sections before they took effect. After other amendments by Pub. L. 117–81, section 2350l was not transferred, and sections 2368 and 2367 were transferred to sections 4124 and 4126 of this title, respectively.
