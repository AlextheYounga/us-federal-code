[Pub. L. 116–92, §1731(d), and Pub. L. 116–283, §216(b), made identical amendments to section 233(c)(2)(C)(ii) of Pub. L. 114–328, set out above, by substituting "Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology" for "Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics", both effective as of Dec. 23, 2016, and as if included in such section as enacted. However, the substitution reflects execution of the amendment made by Pub. L. 116–283 and not by Pub.
