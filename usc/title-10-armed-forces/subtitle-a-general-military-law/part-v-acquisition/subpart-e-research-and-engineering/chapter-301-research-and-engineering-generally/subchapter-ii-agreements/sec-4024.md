### §4024. Merit-based award of grants for research and development ###

(a) It is the policy of Congress that an agency named in section 2303(a) <sup><a href="#4024_1_target" name="4024_1">1</a></sup> of this title should not be required by legislation to award a new grant for research, development, test, or evaluation to a non-Federal Government entity. It is further the policy of Congress that any program, project, or technology identified in legislation be awarded through merit-based selection procedures.

(b) A provision of law may not be construed as requiring a new grant to be awarded to a specified non-Federal Government entity unless that provision of law—

(1) specifically refers to this subsection;

(2) specifically identifies the particular non-Federal Government entity involved; and

(3) specifically states that the award to that entity is required by such provision of law in contravention of the policy set forth in subsection (a).

(c) For purposes of this section, a grant is a new grant unless the work provided for in the grant is a continuation of the work performed by the specified entity under a preceding grant.

(d) This section shall not apply with respect to any grant that calls upon the National Academy of Sciences to investigate, examine, or experiment upon any subject of science or art of significance to an agency named in section 2303(a) <sup><a href="#4024_1_target" name="4024_1">1</a></sup> of this title and to report on such matters to the Congress or any agency of the Federal Government.

(Added Pub. L. 103–355, title VII, §7203(a)(2), Oct. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 3380, §2374; renumbered §4024 and amended Pub. L. 116–283, div. A, title XVIII, §§1841(b)(1), (c), 1883(b)(2), Jan. 1, 2021, 134 Stat. 4243, 4294; Pub. L. 117–81, div. A, title XVII, §1701(u)(2)(B), (D), Dec. 27, 2021, 135 Stat. 2151.)

#### **Editorial Notes** ####

#### References in Text ####

Section 2303(a) of this title, referred to in subsecs. (a) and (d), probably should be a reference to section 3063 of this title, as the list of covered agencies formerly contained in section 2303(a) of this title was transferred to section 3063 by Pub. L. 116–283, div. A, title XVIII, §1807(c)(2), Jan. 1, 2021, 134 Stat. 4157. In addition, Pub. L. 117–81, div. A, title XVII, §1701(d)(7), Dec. 27, 2021, 135 Stat. 2136, substituted "section 3063" for "section 2303(a)" in subsecs. (a) and (d) of section 4008 of this title, which is where this section had originally been transferred by Pub. L. 116–283. However, because the transfer destination was changed from section 4008 to this section before the substitution became effective, that substitution could not be executed in section 4008, as it no longer existed, nor in this section, as it was not amended.

#### Amendments ####

**2021**—Pub. L. 116–283, §1841(c), which directed the renumbering of section 2374 of this title as section 4008 instead of this section, was amended generally by Pub. L. 117–81, §1701(u)(2)(D), effective as if included therein, so that such renumbering was no longer directed.

Pub. L. 116–283, §1841(b)(1), as amended by Pub. L. 117–81, §1701(u)(2)(B), renumbered section 2374 of this title as this section.

Subsecs. (a), (d). Pub. L. 116–283, §1883(b)(2), which directed that each reference in the text of title 10 to a section that was redesignated by title XVIII of Pub. L. 116–283, as such section was in effect before the redesignation, be amended by striking such reference and inserting a reference to the appropriate redesignated section, was not executed with respect to "section 2303(a)", which was redesignated as multiple sections.
