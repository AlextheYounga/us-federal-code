#### Codification ####

As enacted, Pub. L. 116–283, div. A, title XVIII, §1841(c), Jan. 1, 2021, 134 Stat. 4243, originally transferred sections 2374 and 2357 of this title to sections 4008 and 4009, respectively, to become effective Jan. 1, 2022. However, Pub. L. 117–81, div. A, title XVII, §1701(u)(2)(D), Dec. 27, 2021, 135 Stat. 2151, amended section 1841(c) of Pub. L. 116–283, effective as if included therein, so as to eliminate those transfers, thereby omitting these sections before they took effect. Other amendments by Pub. L. 117–81 resulted in transfers of sections 2374 and 2357 to sections 4024 and 4067 of this title, respectively.

Pub. L. 117–81, div. A, title XVII, §1701(d)(7), Dec. 27, 2021, 135 Stat. 2136, which directed amendment of section 4008 of this title by substituting "section 3063" for "section 2303(a)" in subsecs. (a) and (d), effective after the amendments by title XVIII of Pub. L. 116–283 took effect, could not be executed after the amendment by section 1701(u)(2)(D) of Pub. L. 117–81, which eliminated the transfer of section 2374 of this title to section 4008, effective as if included in title XVIII of Pub. L. 116–283.
