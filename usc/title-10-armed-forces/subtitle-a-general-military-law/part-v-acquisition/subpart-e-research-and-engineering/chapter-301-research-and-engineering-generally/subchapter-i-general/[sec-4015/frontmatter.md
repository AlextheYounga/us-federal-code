As enacted, Pub. L. 116–283, div. A, title XVIII, §1841(c), Jan. 1, 2021, 134 Stat. 4243, originally transferred section 2361 of this title to this section, to become effective Jan. 1, 2022. Subsequently, Pub. L. 117–81, div. A, title XVII, §1701(u)(2)(D), Dec. 27, 2021, 135 Stat. 2151, amended section 1841(c) of Pub. L. 116–283, effective as if included therein, so as to eliminate that transfer, thereby omitting this section before it took effect. Another amendment by Pub. L. 117–81 resulted in the transfer of section 2361 to section 4141 of this title.
