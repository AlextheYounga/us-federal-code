#### Pilot Program To Test Machine-Vision Technologies To Determine the Authenticity and Security of Microelectronic Parts in Weapon Systems ####

Pub. L. 115–232, div. A, title VIII, §843, Aug. 13, 2018, 132 Stat. 1878, as amended by Pub. L. 116–283, div. A, title XVIII, §§1806(e)(3)(C), 1866(d)(1), Jan. 1, 2021, 134 Stat. 4156, 4280, provided that:

"(a) Pilot Program Authorized.—The Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, in coordination with the Defense Microelectronics Activity, shall establish a pilot program to test the feasibility and reliability of using machine-vision technologies to determine the authenticity and security of microelectronic parts in weapon systems.

"(b) Objectives of Pilot Program.—The Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, in coordination with the Defense Microelectronics Activity, shall design any pilot program conducted under this section to determine the following:

"(1) The effectiveness and technology readiness level of machine-vision technologies to determine the authenticity of microelectronic parts at the time of the creation of such part through final insertion of such part into weapon systems.

"(2) The best method of incorporating machine-vision technologies into the process of developing, transporting, and inserting microelectronics into weapon systems.

"(3) The rules, regulations, or processes that hinder the development and incorporation of machine-vision technologies, and the application of such rules, regulations, or processes to mitigate counterfeit microelectronics proliferation throughout the Department of Defense.

"(c) Consultation.—To develop the pilot program under this section, the Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, in coordination with the Defense Microelectronics Activity, may consult with the following entities:

"(1) Manufacturers of semiconductors or electronics.

"(2) Industry associations relating to semiconductors or electronics.

"(3) Original equipment manufacturers of products for the Department of Defense.

"(4) Nontraditional defense contractors (as defined in section 3014 of title 10, United States Code) that are machine vision companies.

"(5) Federal laboratories (as defined in section 4801(5) of title 10, United States Code).

"(6) Other elements of the Department of Defense that fall under the authority of the Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering.

"(d) Commencement and Duration.—The pilot program established under this section shall be established not later than April 1, 2019, and all activities under such pilot program shall terminate not later than December 31, 2020."

[Pub. L. 116–283, §1866(d)(1)(A), which directed amendment of section 843(c)(4) of Pub. L. 115–232, set out above, by substituting "section 3021" for "section 2302(9)", could not be executed because of the intervening amendment by section 1806(e)(3)(C) of Pub. L. 116–283, which had substituted "section 3014" for "section 2302(9)".]
