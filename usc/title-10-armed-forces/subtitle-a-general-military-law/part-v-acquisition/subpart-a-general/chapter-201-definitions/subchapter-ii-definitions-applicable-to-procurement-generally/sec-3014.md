#### **Editorial Notes** ####

#### References in Text ####

Sections 4002(a) and 4003 of this title, referred to in text, probably should be references to sections 4021(a) and 4022 of this title. Pub. L. 116–283, div.

L. 116–283, effective as if included therein, so as to eliminate those transfers and instead transfer sections 2371 and 2371b to sections 4021 and 4022 of this title, respectively.
