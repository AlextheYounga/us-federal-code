#### **Editorial Notes** ####

#### References in Text ####

Section 4002 of this title, referred to in subsec. (c)(1), probably should be a reference to section 4021 of this title. Pub. L. 116–283, div. A, title XVIII, §1841(b)(1), Jan. 1, 2021, 134 Stat. 4243, initially transferred section 2371 of this title to section 4002, to become effective Jan. 1, 2022. However, Pub. L. 117–81, div. A, title XVII, §1701(u)(2)(B), Dec. 27, 2021, 135 Stat. 2151, amended section 1841(b)(1) of Pub. L. 116–283, effective as if included therein, so as to eliminate the transfer to section 4002 and instead transfer section 2371 to section 4021 of this title.
