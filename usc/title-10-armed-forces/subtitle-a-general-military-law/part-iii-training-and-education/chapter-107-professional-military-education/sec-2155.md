Such an exception may be granted only on a case-by-case basis under exceptional circumstances, as determined by the Chairman. An officer selected to receive such an exception shall have knowledge of joint matters and other aspects of the Phase I curriculum that, to the satisfaction of the Chairman, qualifies the officer to meet the minimum requirements established for entry into Phase II instruction without first completing Phase I instruction.

(b) Phase II Requirements.—The Secretary shall require that the curriculum for Phase II joint professional military education at any school—

(1) focus on developing joint operational expertise and perspectives and honing joint warfighting skills; and

(2) be structured—

(A) so as to adequately prepare students to perform effectively in an assignment to a joint, multiservice organization; and

(B) so that students progress from a basic knowledge of joint matters learned in Phase I instruction to the level of expertise necessary for successful performance in the joint arena.

(c) Curriculum Content.—In addition to the subjects specified in section 2151(a) of this title, the curriculum for Phase II joint professional military education shall include the following:

(1) National security strategy.

(2) Theater strategy and campaigning.

(3) Joint planning processes and systems.

(4) Joint, interagency, and multinational capabilities and the integration of those capabilities.

(1) the percentage of students enrolled in any such course who are officers of the armed force that administers the school may not exceed 60 percent, with the remaining services proportionally represented; and

(2) of the faculty at the school who are active-duty officers who provide instruction in such courses, the percentage who are officers of the armed force that administers the school may not exceed 60 percent, with the remaining services proportionally represented.
