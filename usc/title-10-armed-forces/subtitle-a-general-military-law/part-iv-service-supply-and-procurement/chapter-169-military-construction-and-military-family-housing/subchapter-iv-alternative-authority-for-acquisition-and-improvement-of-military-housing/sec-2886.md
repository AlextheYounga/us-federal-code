### §2886. Prohibiting collection of amounts in addition to rent from members assigned to units ###

(a) Prohibition.—An agreement for acquiring or constructing a military family housing unit or military unaccompanied housing unit under this subchapter which is entered into between the Secretary and an eligible entity shall prohibit the entity from imposing on a member of the armed forces who occupies the unit a supplemental payment, such as an out-of-pocket fee, in addition to the amount of rent the eligible entity charges for a unit of similar size and composition, without regard to whether or not the amount of the member's basic allowance for housing is less than the amount of the rent.

(b) Permitting Certain Additional Payments.—Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit an eligible entity from imposing an additional payment for optional services provided to residents, such as access to a gym or a parking space, or an additional payment for non-essential utility services, as determined in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary.

(c) No Effect on Rental Guarantees or Differential Lease Payments.—Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit or otherwise affect the authority of the Secretary to enter into rental guarantee agreements under section 2876 of this title or to make differential lease payments under section 2877 of this title, so long as such agreements or payments do not require a member of the armed forces who is assigned to a military family housing unit or military unaccompanied housing unit under this subchapter to pay an out-of-pocket fee or payment in addition to the member's basic housing allowance.
