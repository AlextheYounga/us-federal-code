(b) Project Funding.—The Secretary of Defense may fund authorized expenditures of projects accepted under subsection (a) with—

(1) contributions under subsection (c);

(3)(A) If contributions are made under paragraph (1) as reimbursement for a project or portion of a project previously completed by the Department of Defense, such contributions shall be credited to—
