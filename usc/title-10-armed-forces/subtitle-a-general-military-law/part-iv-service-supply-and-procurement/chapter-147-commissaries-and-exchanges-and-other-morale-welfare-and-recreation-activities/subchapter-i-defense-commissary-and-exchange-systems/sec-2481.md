"(1) Programs authorized.—After the reports required by subsections (a) and (d) have been submitted as described in such subsections, the Secretary may, notwithstanding any requirement in chapter 147 of title 10, United States Code, conduct one or more pilot programs to evaluate the feasibility and advisability of processes and methods for achieving budget-neutrality in the delivery of commissary and exchange benefits and other applicable benchmarks in accordance with this section. The Secretary may authorize any commissary or exchange, or private sector entity, participating in any such pilot program to establish appropriate prices in response to market conditions and customer demand, provided that the level of savings required by paragraph (3) is maintained.

"(2) Benchmarks.—If the Secretary conducts a pilot program under this subsection, the Secretary shall establish specific, measurable benchmarks for measuring success in the provision of high quality grocery goods and products, discount savings to patrons, and high levels of customer satisfaction while achieving budget-neutrality in the delivery of commissary and exchange benefits under the pilot program.

"(3) Required savings to patrons.—The Secretary shall ensure that the level of savings to commissary and exchange patrons under any pilot program under this subsection is not less than the level of savings to such patrons before the implementation of such pilot program, as follows:

"(A) Before commencing a pilot program the Secretary shall establish a baseline of savings to patrons achieved for each commissary or exchange to participate in such pilot program by comparing prices charged by such commissary or exchange for a representative market basket of goods to prices charged by local competitors for the same market basket of goods.

"(B) After commencement of such pilot program, the Secretary shall ensure that each commissary or exchange, or private sector entity, participating in such pilot program conducts market-basket price comparisons not less than once a month and adjusts pricing as necessary to ensure that pricing achieves savings to patrons under such pilot program that are reasonably consistent with the baseline savings for the commissary or exchange established pursuant to subparagraph (A).
