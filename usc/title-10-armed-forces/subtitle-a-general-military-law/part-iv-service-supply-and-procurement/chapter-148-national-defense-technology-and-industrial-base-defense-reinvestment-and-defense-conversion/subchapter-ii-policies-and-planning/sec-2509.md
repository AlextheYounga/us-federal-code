"(2) Company.—The term 'company' means any corporation, company, limited liability company, limited partnership, business trust, business association, or other similar entity.

"(4) Foreign ownership, control, or influence; foci.—The terms 'foreign ownership, control, or influence' and 'FOCI' have the meanings given those terms in the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (DOD 5220.22–M), or a successor document.

"(b) Improved Assessment and Mitigation of Risks Related to Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence.—

"(1) In general.—In developing and implementing the analytical framework for mitigating risk relating to ownership structures, as required by section 2509 of title 10, United States Code, as added by section 845 of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall improve the process and procedures for the assessment and mitigation of risks related to foreign ownership, control, or influence (FOCI) of contractors and subcontractors doing business with the Department of Defense.

"(2) Elements.—The process and procedures for the assessment and mitigation of risk relating to ownership structures referred to in paragraph (1) shall include the following elements:

"(A) Assessment of foci.—(i) A requirement for covered contractors and subcontractors to disclose to the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency, or its successor organization, their beneficial ownership and whether they are under FOCI.

"(ii) A requirement to update such disclosures when changes occur to information previously provided, consistent with or similar to the procedures for updating FOCI information under the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (DOD 5220.22–M), or a successor document.

"(iii) A requirement for covered contractors and subcontractors determined to be under FOCI to disclose contact information for each of its foreign owners that is a beneficial owner.

"(iv) A requirement that, at a minimum, the disclosures required by this paragraph be provided at the time the contract or subcontract is awarded, amended, or renewed, but in no case later than one year after the Secretary prescribes regulations to carry out this subsection.

"(B) Responsibility determination.—Consistent with section 2509 of title 10, United States Code, as added by section 845 of this Act, consideration of FOCI risks as part of responsibility determinations, including—

"(i) whether to establish a special standard of responsibility relating to FOCI risks for covered contractors or subcontractors, and the extent to which the policies and procedures consistent with or similar to those relating to FOCI under the National Industrial Security Program shall be applied to covered contractors or subcontractors;

"(ii) procedures for contracting officers making responsibility determinations regarding whether covered contractors and subcontractors may be under foreign ownership, control, or influence and for determining whether there is reason to believe that such foreign ownership, control, or influence would pose a risk or potential risk to national security or potential compromise because of sensitive data, systems, or processes, such as personally identifiable information, cybersecurity, or national security systems involved with the contract or subcontract; and

"(iii) modification of policies, directives, and practices to provide that an assessment that a covered contractor or subcontractor is under FOCI may be a sufficient basis for a contracting officer to determine that a contractor or subcontractor is not responsible.

"(C) Contract requirements, administration, and oversight relating to foci.—

"(i) Requirements for contract clauses providing for and enforcing disclosures related to changes in FOCI or beneficial ownership during performance of the contract or subcontract, consistent with subparagraph (A), and necessitating the effective mitigation of risks related to FOCI throughout the duration of the contract or subcontract.

"(2) Research and development and procurement activities.—The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that the requirements of this section are applied to research and development and procurement activities, including for the delivery of services, established through any means including those under section 2358(b) of title 10, United States Code.
