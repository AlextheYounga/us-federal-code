(c) Before carrying out a military construction project described in subsection (b) using proceeds from sales under subsection (a), the Secretary concerned shall notify Congress of the project, the justification for the project, and the estimated cost of the project. The project may be carried out only after the end of the 14-day period beginning on the date the notification is received by Congress in an electronic medium pursuant to section 480 of this title.
