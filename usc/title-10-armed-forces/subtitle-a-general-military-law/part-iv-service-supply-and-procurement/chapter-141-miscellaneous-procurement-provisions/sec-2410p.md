"(2) The Department of Defense organization responsible for the development or production of the major system ensures that Federal employees are responsible for—

"(A) determining courses of action to be taken in the best interest of the government; and

"(d) Definitions.—In this section:

"(1) Lead systems integrator.—The term 'lead systems integrator' means—

"(A) a prime contractor for the development or production of a major system, if the prime contractor is not expected at the time of award to perform a substantial portion of the work on the system and the major subsystems; or

"(B) a prime contractor under a contract for the procurement of services the primary purpose of which is to perform acquisition functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions with respect to the development or production of a major system.

"(2) New contracts.—In applying subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2), any modification to the existing contract for the Future Combat Systems program, for the purpose of entering into full-rate production of major systems or subsystems, shall be considered a new contract."
