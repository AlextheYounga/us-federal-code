Each construction or facility improvement project on the list shall be delineated by project location, project title or description, project cost, including costs covered by the host country, and authority used to undertake the project.

(D) For each overseas military location first designated as an enduring location in one of the previous two required reports, a list of required construction and facility improvement projects anticipated to be carried out by the Department of Defense directly or through the acceptance of payments-in-kind during the fiscal year in which the report is submitted and the next four fiscal years. Each construction or facility improvement project on the list shall be delineated by project location, project title or description, estimated project cost, including costs anticipated to be covered by the host country, and authority to be used to undertake the project.

(E) An overview of any annual lease or access costs to the United States for each overseas military location designated as an enduring location.

(H) A summary of any force protection risks identified for cooperative security locations and contingency locations, the actions proposed to mitigate such risks, and the resourcing and implementation plan to implement the mitigation actions.

(I) Such other such matters related to overseas military locations as the Secretary of Defense considers appropriate.

(3) In this subsection:

(A)(i) The term "overseas military location" covers both enduring locations and contingency locations established outside the United States.

(ii) An enduring location is primarily characterized either by the presence of permanently assigned United States forces with robust infrastructure and quality of life amenities to support that presence, by the sustained presence of allocated United States forces with infrastructure and quality of life amenities consistent with that presence, or by the periodic presence of allocated United States forces with little or no permanent United States military presence or controlled infrastructure. Enduring locations include main operating bases, forward operating sites, and cooperative security locations.

(iii) A contingency location refers to a location outside of the United States that is not covered by subparagraph (B), but that is used by United States forces to support and sustain operations during named and unnamed contingency operations or other operations as directed by appropriate authority and is categorized by mission life-cycle requirements as initial, temporary, or semi-permanent.

(B)(i) The term "construction or facility improvement project" includes any construction, development, conversion, or extension of a building, structure, or other improvement to real property carried out at an overseas military location, whether to satisfy temporary or permanent requirements, and any acquisition of land for an overseas military location.

(ii) The term does not include repairs to a building, structure, or other improvement to real property, unless the building, structure, or other improvement cannot effectively be used for its designated functional purpose in the absence of the repairs.

(4) The Secretary of Defense shall prepare the report under paragraph (1) in coordination with the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy and the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment.

(5) A report under paragraph (1) shall be submitted in unclassified form, but may contain a classified annex as necessary.

(b) Department of Defense Overseas Military Facility Investment Recovery Account.—(1) Except as provided in subsection (c), amounts paid to the United States, pursuant to any treaty, status of forces agreement, or other international agreement to which the United States is a party, for the residual value of real property or improvements to real property used by civilian or military personnel of the Department of Defense shall be deposited into the Department of Defense Overseas Military Facility Investment Recovery Account.

(2) Money deposited in the Department of Defense Overseas Military Facility Investment Recovery Account shall be available to the Secretary of Defense for payment, as provided in appropriation Acts, of costs incurred by the Department of Defense in connection with—

(A) military construction, facility maintenance and repair, and environmental restoration at military installations in the United States; and

(B) military construction, facility maintenance and repair, and compliance with applicable environmental laws at military installations outside the United States at which the Secretary anticipates the United States will have an enduring presence.

(3) Funds in the Department of Defense Overseas Facility Investment Recovery Account shall remain available until expended.

(4) Not later than December 1 of each year, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional defense committees a report detailing all expenditures made from the Department of Defense Overseas Facility Investment Recovery Account during the preceding fiscal year.

(c) Treatment of Amounts Corresponding to the Value of Property Purchased With Nonappropriated Funds.—In the case of a payment referred to in subsection (b)(1) for the residual value of real property or improvements at an overseas military facility, the portion of the payment that is equal to the depreciated value of the investment made with nonappropriated funds shall be deposited in the reserve account established under section 204(b)(7)(C) of the Defense Authorization Amendments and Base Closure and Realignment Act (Public Law 100–526; 10 U.S.C. 2687 note). The Secretary of Defense may use amounts in the account (in such an aggregate amount as is provided in advance by appropriation Acts) for the purpose of acquiring, constructing, or improving commissary stores and nonappropriated fund instrumentalities.

(d) OMB Review of Proposed Overseas Basing Settlements.—(1) The Secretary of Defense may not enter into an agreement of settlement with a host country regarding the release to the host country of improvements made by the United States to facilities at an installation located in the host country until 30 days after the date on which the Secretary submits the proposed settlement to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. The prohibition set forth in the preceding sentence shall apply only to agreements of settlement for improvements having a value in excess of $10,000,000. The Director shall evaluate the overall equity of the proposed settlement. In evaluating the proposed settlement, the Director shall consider such factors as the extent of the United States capital investment in the improvements being released to the host country, the depreciation of the improvements, the condition of the improvements, and any applicable requirements for environmental remediation or restoration at the installation.

(2) Each year, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives a report on each proposed agreement of settlement that was not submitted by the Secretary to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget in the previous year under paragraph (1) because the fair market value of the improvements to be released pursuant to the proposed agreement did not exceed $10,000,000.

(e) Congressional Oversight of Use of Payments-In-Kind for Construction or Operations.—(1) Before concluding an agreement for acceptance of military construction or facility improvements as a payment-in-kind, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional defense committees a notification on the proposed agreement.

Any such notification shall contain the following:

(A) A description of each activity to be covered by the payment-in-kind.

(B) A certification that the costs to be covered by the payment-in-kind are included in the budget of one or more of the military departments or that it will otherwise be necessary to provide for payment of such costs in a budget of one or more of the military departments in the current or the next fiscal year.

(3) When the Secretary of Defense submits a notification of a proposed agreement under paragraph (1) or (2), the Secretary may then enter into the agreement described in the notification only after the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the notification is submitted or, if earlier, the end of the 14-day period beginning on the date on which a copy of the notification is provided in an electronic medium pursuant to section 480 of this title.

(f) Acceptance of Military Construction Projects As Payments-In-Kind and In-Kind Contributions.—(1)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a military construction project costing more than $6,000,000 may be accepted as payment-in-kind or as an in-kind contribution required by a bilateral agreement with a host country only if that military construction project is authorized by law.

(B) Subparagraph (A) does not apply to a military construction project that—

(i) was specified in a bilateral agreement with a host country that was entered into before December 26, 2013;

(ii) was the subject of negotiation between the United States and a host country as of the date of the enactment of the Military Construction Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015; or

(2)(A) If the Secretary of Defense accepts a military construction project to be built for Department of Defense personnel outside the United States as a payment-in-kind or an in-kind contribution required by a bilateral agreement with a host country, the Secretary shall submit to the congressional defense committees a written notification at least 30 days before the initiation date for any such military construction project.

(B) A notification under subparagraph (A) with respect to a proposed military construction project shall include the following:

(i) The requirements for, and purpose and description of, the proposed project.

(ii) The cost of the proposed project.

(iii) The scope of the proposed project.

(iv) The schedule for the proposed project.
