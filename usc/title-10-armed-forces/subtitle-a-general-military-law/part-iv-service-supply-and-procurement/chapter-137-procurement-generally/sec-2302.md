In clause (1), the words "(if any)" are omitted as surplusage. The words "Secretary of the Treasury" are substituted for the words "Commandant, United States Coast Guard, Treasury Department", since the functions of the Coast Guard and its officers, while operating under the Department of the Treasury, were vested in the Secretary of the Treasury by 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 26, effective July 31, 1950, 64 Stat. 1280. Under that plan the Secretary of the Treasury was authorized to delegate any of those functions to the agencies and employees of the Department of the Treasury.

Clauses (2) and (3) are inserted for clarity, and are based on the usage of those terms throughout the revised chapter.

"(I) include in its subcontracts a payment term requiring payment within 7 days (or some other fixed term) after receiving payment from the Government; and

"(II) submit with its payment request to the Government a certification that it has timely paid its subcontractors in accordance with their subcontracts from funds previously received as progress payments and will timely make required payments to such subcontractors from the proceeds of the progress payment covered by the certification;

"(iii) evaluating the feasibility and desirability of requiring that all prime contractors (other than a construction prime contractor subject to the provisions of sections 3903(b) and 3905 of title 31, United States Code) furnish with its payment request to the Government proof of payment of the amounts included in such payment request for payments made to subcontractors and suppliers;

"(iv) evaluating the feasibility and desirability of requiring a prime contractor to establish an escrow account at a federally insured financial institution and requiring direct disbursements to subcontractors and suppliers of amounts certified by the prime contractor in its payment request to the Government as being payable to such subcontractors and suppliers in accordance with their subcontracts; and

"(v) evaluating the feasibility and desirability of requiring direct disbursement of amounts certified by a prime contractor as being payable to its subcontractors and suppliers in accordance with their subcontracts (using techniques such as joint payee checks, escrow accounts, or direct payment by the Government), if the contracting officer has determined that the prime contractor is failing to make timely payments to its subcontractors and suppliers.

"(B) Payment protection of subcontractors and suppliers through the use of payment bonds or alternatives methods by—

"(II) ultimate payment of such amounts due;

"(iii) evaluating the feasibility and desirability of increasing the payment bond amounts required under the Miller Act from the current maximum amounts to an amount equal to 100 percent of the amount of the contract;

"(iv) evaluating the feasibility and desirability of requiring payment bonds for supply and services contracts (other than construction), and, if feasible and desirable, the amounts of such bonds; and

"(v) evaluating the feasibility and desirability of using letters of credit issued by federally insured financial institutions (or other alternatives) as substitutes for payment bonds in providing payment protection to subcontractors and suppliers on construction contracts (and other contracts).

"(C) Any evaluation of feasibility and desirability carried out pursuant to subparagraph (A) or (B) shall include the appropriateness of—

"(i) any differential treatment of, or impact on, small business concerns as opposed to concerns other than small business concerns;

"(iii) extending the protections regarding payment to all tiers of subcontractors or restricting them to first-tier subcontractors and direct suppliers.

"(3) The report required by paragraph (1) shall include a description of the results of the assessment carried out pursuant to paragraph (2) and may include recommendations pertaining to any of the following:

"(A) Statutory and regulatory changes providing payment protections for subcontractors and suppliers (other than a construction prime contractor subject to the provisions of sections 3903(b) and 3905 of title 31, United States Code) that the Comptroller General believes to be desirable and feasible.

"(B) Proposals to assess the desirability and utility of a specific payment protection on a test basis.

"(1) enhance the capabilities of disadvantaged small business concerns to perform as subcontractors and suppliers under Department of Defense contracts and other contracts and subcontracts; and

"(2) increase the participation of such business concerns as subcontractors and suppliers under Department of Defense contracts, other Federal Government contracts, and commercial contracts.

"(c) Program Participants.—(1) A business concern meeting the eligibility requirements set out in subsection (d) may enter into agreements under subsection (e) and furnish assistance to disadvantaged small business concerns upon making application to the Secretary of Defense and being approved for participation in the pilot program by the Secretary. A business concern participating in the pilot program pursuant to such an approval shall be known, for the purposes of the program, as a 'mentor firm'.

"(2) A disadvantaged small business concern eligible for the award of Federal contracts may obtain assistance from a mentor firm upon entering into an agreement with the mentor firm as provided in subsection (e).

"(B) demonstrates that it—

"(i) is qualified to provide assistance that will contribute to the purpose of the program;

"(ii) is of good financial health and character and does not appear on a Federal list of debarred or suspended contractors; and

"(iii) can impart value to a protege firm because of experience gained as a Department of Defense contractor or through knowledge of general business operations and government contracting, as demonstrated by evidence that—

 "(I) during the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which the mentor firm enters into the agreement, the total amount of the Department of Defense contracts awarded such mentor firm and the subcontracts awarded such mentor firm under Department of Defense contracts was equal to or greater than $100,000,000; or

 "(II) the mentor firm demonstrates the capability to assist in the development of protege firms, and is approved by the Secretary of Defense pursuant to criteria specified in the regulations prescribed pursuant to subsection (k).

"(2) A mentor firm may not enter into an agreement with a protege firm if the Administrator of the Small Business Administration has made a determination finding affiliation between the mentor firm and the protege firm.

"(3) If the Administrator of the Small Business Administration has not made such a determination and if the Secretary has reason to believe (based on the regulations promulgated by the Administrator regarding affiliation) that the mentor firm is affiliated with the protege firm, the Secretary shall request a determination regarding affiliation from the Administrator of the Small Business Administration.

"(e) Mentor-Protege Agreement.—Before providing assistance to a protege firm under the program, a mentor firm shall enter into a mentor-protege agreement with the protege firm regarding the assistance to be provided by the mentor firm. The agreement shall include the following:

"(2) A program participation term for any period of not more than two years, except that the term may be a period of up to five years if the Secretary of Defense determines in writing that unusual circumstances justify a program participation term in excess of two years.

"(3) Procedures for the protege firm to terminate the agreement voluntarily and for the mentor firm to terminate the agreement for cause.

"(f) Forms of Assistance.—A mentor firm may provide a protege firm the following:

"(1) Assistance, by using mentor firm personnel, in—

"(A) general business management, including organizational management, financial management, and personnel management, marketing, and overall business planning;

"(B) engineering and technical matters such as production, inventory control, and quality assurance; and

"(C) any other assistance designed to develop the capabilities of the protege firm under the developmental program referred to in subsection (e).

"(2) Award of subcontracts on a noncompetitive basis to the protege firm under the Department of Defense or other contracts.

"(3) Payment of progress payments for performance of the protege firm under such a subcontract in amounts as provided for in the subcontract, but in no event may any such progress payment exceed 100 percent of the costs incurred by the protege firm for the performance.

"(4) Advance payments under such subcontracts.

"(B) The determinations made in annual performance reviews of a mentor firm's mentor-protege agreement shall be a major factor in the determinations of amounts of reimbursement, if any, that the mentor firm is eligible to receive in the remaining years of the program participation term under the agreement.

"(C) The total amount reimbursed under this paragraph to a mentor firm for costs of assistance furnished in a fiscal year to a protege firm may not exceed $1,000,000, except in a case in which the Secretary of Defense determines in writing that unusual circumstances justify a reimbursement of a higher amount.

"(D) The Secretary may not reimburse any fee assessed by the mentor firm for services provided to the protege firm pursuant to subsection (f)(6) or for business development expenses incurred by the mentor firm under a contract awarded to the mentor firm while participating in a joint venture with the protege firm.

"(3)(A) Costs incurred by a mentor firm in providing assistance to a protege firm that are not reimbursed pursuant to paragraph (2) shall be recognized as credit in lieu of subcontract awards for purposes of determining whether the mentor firm attains a subcontracting participation goal applicable to such mentor firm under a Department of Defense contract, under a contract with another executive agency, or under a divisional or company-wide subcontracting plan negotiated with the Department of Defense or another executive agency.

"(B) The amount of the credit given a mentor firm for any such unreimbursed costs shall be equal to—

"(C) Under regulations prescribed pursuant to subsection (k), the Secretary of Defense shall adjust the amount of credit given a mentor firm pursuant to subparagraphs (A) and (B) if the Secretary determines that the firm's performance regarding the award of subcontracts to disadvantaged small business concerns has declined without justifiable cause.

"(4) A mentor firm shall receive credit toward the attainment of a subcontracting participation goal applicable to such mentor firm for each subcontract for a product or service awarded under such contract by a mentor firm to a business concern that, except for its size, would be a small business concern owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, but only if—

"(A) the size of such business concern is not more than two times the maximum size specified by the Administrator of the Small Business Administration for purposes of determining whether a business concern furnishing such product or service is a small business concern; and

"(B) the business concern formerly had a mentor-protege agreement with such mentor firm that was not terminated for cause.

"(h) Relationship to Small Business Act.—(1) For purposes of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631 et seq.), no determination of affiliation or control (either direct or indirect) may be found between a protege firm and its mentor firm on the basis that the mentor firm has agreed to furnish (or has furnished) to its protege firm pursuant to a mentor-protege agreement any form of developmental assistance described in subsection (f).

"(2) Notwithstanding section 8 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637), the Small Business Administration may not determine a disadvantaged small business concern to be ineligible to receive any assistance authorized under the Small Business Act on the basis that such business concern has participated in the Mentor-Protege Program or has received assistance pursuant to any developmental assistance agreement authorized under such program.

"(3) The Small Business Administration may not require a firm that is entering into, or has entered into, an agreement under subsection (e) as a protege firm to submit the agreement, or any other document required by the Secretary of Defense in the administration of the Mentor-Protege Program, to the Small Business Administration for review, approval, or any other purpose.
