### §2333. Joint policies on requirements definition, contingency program management, and contingency contracting ###

(1) The assignment of a senior commissioned officer or civilian member of the senior executive service, with appropriate experience and qualifications related to the definition of requirements to be satisfied through acquisition contracts (such as for delivery of products or services, performance of work, or accomplishment of a project), to act as head of requirements definition and coordination during combat operations, post-conflict operations, and contingency operations, if required, including leading a requirements review board involving all organizations concerned.

(2) An organizational approach to requirements definition and coordination during combat operations, post-conflict operations, and contingency operations that is designed to ensure that requirements are defined in a way that effectively implements United States Government and Department of Defense objectives, policies, and decisions regarding the allocation of resources, coordination of interagency efforts in the theater of operations, and alignment of requirements with the proper use of funds.

(c) Contingency Program Management Matters Covered.—The joint policy for contingency program management required by subsection (a) shall, at a minimum, provide for the following:

(1) The assignment of a senior commissioned officer or civilian member of the senior executive service, with appropriate program management experience and qualifications, to act as head of program management during combat operations, post-conflict operations, and contingency operations, including stabilization and reconstruction operations involving multiple United States Government agencies and international organizations, if required.

(2) A preplanned organizational approach to program management during combat operations, post-conflict operations, and contingency operations that is designed to ensure that the Department of Defense is prepared to conduct such program management.

(3) Identification of a deployable cadre of experts, with the appropriate tools and authority, and trained in processes under paragraph (6).

(4) Utilization of the hiring and appointment authorities necessary for the rapid deployment of personnel to ensure the availability of key personnel for sufficient lengths of time to provide for continuing program and project management.

(5) A requirement to provide training (including training under a program to be created by the Defense Acquisition University) to program management personnel in—

(A) the use of laws, regulations, policies, and directives related to program management in combat or contingency environments;

(B) the integration of cost, schedule, and performance objectives into practical acquisition strategies aligned with available resources and subject to effective oversight; and

(C) procedures of the Department of Defense related to funding mechanisms and contingency contract management.

(6) Appropriate steps to ensure that training is maintained for such personnel even when they are not deployed in a contingency operation.

(7) Such steps as may be needed to ensure jointness and cross-service coordination in the area of program management during contingency operations.

(A) The designation of a senior commissioned officer or civilian member of the senior executive service in each military department with the responsibility for administering the policy.

(E) Appropriate steps to ensure that training is maintained for such personnel even when they are not deployed in a contingency operation.

(F) Such steps as may be needed to ensure jointness and cross-service coordination in the area of contingency contracting.

(2) To the extent practicable, the joint policy for contingency contracting required by subsection (a) should be taken into account in the development of interagency plans for stabilization and reconstruction operations, consistent with the report submitted by the President under section 1035 of the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 (Public Law 109–364; 120 Stat. 2388) on interagency operating procedures for the planning and conduct of stabilization and reconstruction operations.
