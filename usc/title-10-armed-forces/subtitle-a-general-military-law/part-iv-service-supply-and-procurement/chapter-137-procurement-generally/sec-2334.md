(3) include the information required in the guidance under paragraph (1)—

(A) in any decision documentation approving a cost estimate within the baseline description or any other cost estimate for use at any event specified in subsection (a)(6); and

(B) in the next Selected Acquisition Report pursuant to section 2432 of this title in the case of a major defense acquisition program or major subprogram, or the next quarterly report pursuant to section 2445c of this title in the case of a major automated information system program.
