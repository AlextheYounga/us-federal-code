#### Codification ####

The text of this section is based on Pub. L. 112–81, div. A, title X, §1077, Dec. 31, 2011, 125 Stat. 1596. Section 1077 of Pub. L. 112–81, formerly classified to section 2514 of Title 50, War and National Defense, was transferred to this section by Pub. L. 112–239, §1031(b)(3)(B)(i)–(iii).

#### Amendments ####

**2013**—Pub. L. 112–239, §1031(b)(3)(C)(ii), made technical amendments to conform section enumerator and catchline to the style of this title. See Codification note above.

Pub. L. 112–239, §1031(b)(3)(B)(iv), which directed amendment of this section by striking “the date of the enactment of this Act” and inserting “December 31, 2011,” and also contained a single subcl. designated (III) again directing “striking ‘the date of the enactment of this Act’ and inserting ‘December 31, 2011,’ ”, was executed by making the substitution in only one place to reflect the probable intent of Congress because “the date of the enactment of this Act” appeared only one time in this section.
