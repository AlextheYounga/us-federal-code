#### Amendments ####

**2022**—Subsec. (d). Pub. L. 117–263, §1636(a), amended subsec. (d) generally. Prior to amendment, text read as follows: "Not less than once every quarter, the Deputy Secretary of Defense and the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff shall jointly provide to the Committees on Armed Services of the House of Representatives and the Senate a briefing on any known or suspected critical intelligence parameter breaches that were identified during the previous quarter, including an assessment of any known or suspected impacts of such breaches to the mission effectiveness of military capabilities as of the date of the briefing or thereafter."

Subsec. (e). Pub. L. 117–263, §1636(b), substituted "December 31, 2032" for "December 31, 2027".

**2021**—Subsec. (c). Pub. L. 117–81, §1534(1), substituted "Reports" for "Report" in heading.

Subsec. (c)(1). Pub. L. 117–81, §1534(2), substituted "For each assessment conducted under subsection (a), the Commanders" for "The Commanders" and "the assessment" for "the assessment required by subsection (a)" in introductory provisions.

Subsec. (c)(2). Pub. L. 117–81, §1534(3), which directed substitution of "each report" for "the report", was executed by making the substitution in both places it appeared, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

Subsec. (c)(3). Pub. L. 117–81, §1534(4), substituted "Not later than 90 days after the date of the submission of a report under paragraph (1), the Secretary" for "The Secretary" and struck out "required by paragraph (1)" before ", any comments".
