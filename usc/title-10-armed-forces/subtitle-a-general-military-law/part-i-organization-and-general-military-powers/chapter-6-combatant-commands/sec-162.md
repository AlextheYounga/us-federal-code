#### Amendments ####

**2016**—Subsec. (a)(1). Pub. L. 114–328, §924(1), substituted "As directed by the Secretary of Defense" for "Except as provided in paragraph (2)" and "specified forces" for "all forces" and struck out "Such assignments shall be made as directed by the Secretary of Defense, including direction as to the command to which forces are to be assigned." before "The Secretary of Defense".

Subsec. (a)(2). Pub. L. 114–328, §924(2), added par. (2) and struck out former par. (2) which read as follows: "Except as otherwise directed by the Secretary of Defense, forces to be assigned by the Secretaries of the military departments to the combatant commands or to the United States element of the North American Aerospace Defense Command under paragraph (1) do not include forces assigned to carry out functions of the Secretary of a military department listed in sections 3013(b), 5013(b), and 8013(b) of this title or forces assigned to multinational peacekeeping organizations."
