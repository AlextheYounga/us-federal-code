#### **Editorial Notes** ####

#### Amendments ####

**2021**—Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 116–283, which directed that each reference in the text of title 10 to a section that was redesignated by title XVIII of Pub. L. 116–283, as such section was in effect before the redesignation, be amended by striking such reference and inserting a reference to the appropriate redesignated section, was executed by substituting "section 3501" for "section 2306b". Section 1822(b) of title XVIII of Pub. L. 116–283 directed the redesignation of section 2306b of this title as section 3501, but such redesignation was executed by transferring the text of section 2306b to section 3501, as the section designation and catchline had already been enacted.
