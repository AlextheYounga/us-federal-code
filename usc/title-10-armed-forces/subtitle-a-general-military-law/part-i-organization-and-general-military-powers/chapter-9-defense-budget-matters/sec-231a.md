(E) For each of the cost estimates required by subparagraphs (C) and (D)—

(i) a description of whether the cost estimate is derived from the cost estimate position of the military department or derived from the cost estimate position of the Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation office of the Secretary of Defense;

(ii) if the cost estimate position of the military department and the cost estimate position of the Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation office differ by more than .5 percent for any aircraft program, an annotated cost estimate difference and sufficient rationale to explain the difference; and

(F) An assessment by the Secretary of Defense of the extent to which the combined aircraft forces of the Department of the Navy, the Department of the Army, and the Department of the Air Force meet the national security requirements of the United States.

(3) For any cost estimate required by paragraph (2)(C) or (D), for any aircraft program for which the Secretary is required to include in a report under section 2432 of this title, the source of the cost information used to prepare the annual aircraft plan, shall be sourced from the Selected Acquisition Report data that the Secretary plans to submit to the congressional defense committees in accordance with subsection (f) of that section for the year for which the annual aircraft plan is prepared.

(4) The annual aircraft procurement plan shall be submitted in unclassified form and shall contain a classified annex.

(d) Assessment When Aircraft Procurement Budget Is Insufficient To Meet Applicable Requirements.—If the budget for a fiscal year provides for funding of the procurement of aircraft for either the Department of the Navy, the Department of the Army, or the Department of the Air Force at a level that is not sufficient to sustain the aviation force structure specified in the aircraft procurement plan for such Department for that fiscal year under subsection (a), the Secretary shall include with the defense budget materials for that fiscal year an assessment that describes and discusses the risks associated with the reduced force structure of aircraft that will result from funding aircraft procurement at such level.
