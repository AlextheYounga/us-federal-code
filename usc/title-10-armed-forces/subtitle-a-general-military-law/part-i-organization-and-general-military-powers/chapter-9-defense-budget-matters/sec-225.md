(II) the acquisition baseline for such program element or major subprogram that was submitted in the report during the previous year; and

(III) the most recent adjusted or revised acquisition baseline for such program element or major subprogram under subsection (d).

(3)(A) Each report under paragraph (1) shall include the total system costs for each element described in subparagraph (B) that comprises the missile defense system, without regard to funding source or management control (such as the Missile Defense Agency, a military department, or other element of the Department of Defense).

(B) The elements described in this subparagraph shall include the following:

(i) Research and development.

(ii) Procurement.

(iii) Military construction.

(iv) Operations and sustainment.

(v) Disposal.

(4) Each report under this subsection shall be submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified annex.

(5) In this subsection:

(A) The term "original acquisition baseline" means, with respect to a program element or major subprogram, the first acquisition baseline created for the program element or major subprogram that has no previous iterations and has not been adjusted or revised, including any adjustments or revisions pursuant to subsection (d).

(B) The term "total system costs" means, with respect to each element that comprises the missile defense system—

(i) all combined costs from closed, canceled, and active acquisition baselines;

(ii) any costs shifted to or a part of future efforts without an established acquisition baseline; and

(iii) any costs under the responsibility of a military department or other Department entity.

(d) Exception to Limitation on Revision.—The Director may adjust or revise an acquisition baseline established under this section if the Director submits to the congressional defense committees notification of—

(1) a justification for such adjustment or revision;

(2) the specific adjustments or revisions made to the acquisition baseline, including to the elements described in subsection (b); and

(3) the effective date of the adjusted or revised acquisition baseline.

(e) Operations and Sustainment Cost Estimates.—The Director shall ensure that each life-cycle cost estimate included in an acquisition baseline pursuant to subsection (b)(3)(A) includes—

(1) all of the operations and sustainment costs for which the Director is responsible;

(2) a description of the operations and sustainment functions and costs for which a military department is responsible;

(3) the amount of operations and sustainment costs (dollar value and base year) for which the military department or other element of the Department of Defense is responsible; and

(4)(A) a citation to the source (such as a joint cost estimate or one or more military department estimates) that captures the operations and sustainment costs for which a military department or other element of the Department of Defense is responsible;

(B) the date the source was prepared; and

(C) if and when the source was independently verified by the Office for Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation.
