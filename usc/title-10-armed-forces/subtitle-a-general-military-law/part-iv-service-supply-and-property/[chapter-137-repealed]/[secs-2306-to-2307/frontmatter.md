"(2) the complexity and technical challenge of the program is not the result of a failure to meet the requirements established in section 2366a of title 10, United States Code [now 10 U.S.C. 4251].

"(e) Justification for Selection of Contract Type.—As modified under subsection (b), the regulations shall require the Milestone Decision Authority to document the basis for the contract type selected for a program.
