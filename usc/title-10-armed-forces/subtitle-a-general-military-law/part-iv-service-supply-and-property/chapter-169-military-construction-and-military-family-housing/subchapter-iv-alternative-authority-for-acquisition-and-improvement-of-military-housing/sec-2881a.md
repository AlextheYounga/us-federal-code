(b) Treatment of Housing; Assignment of Members.—The Secretary of the Navy may assign members of the armed forces without dependents to housing units acquired or constructed under the pilot projects, and such housing units shall be considered as quarters of the United States or a housing facility under the jurisdiction of the Secretary for purposes of section 403 of title 37.

(c) Basic Allowance for Housing.—(1) The Secretary of Defense may prescribe and, under section 403(o) of title 37, pay for members of the armed forces without dependents in privatized housing acquired or constructed under the pilot projects higher rates of partial basic allowance for housing than the rates authorized under paragraph (2) of such section.

(2) The partial basic allowance for housing paid for a member at a higher rate under this subsection may be paid directly to the private sector source of the housing to whom the member is obligated to pay rent or other charge for residing in such housing if the private sector source credits the amount so paid against the amount owed by the member for the rent or other charge.
