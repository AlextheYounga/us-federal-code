### §2804. Contingency construction ###

(a) Within the amount appropriated for such purpose, the Secretary of Defense may carry out a military construction project not otherwise authorized by law, or may authorize the Secretary of a military department to carry out such a project, if the Secretary of Defense determines that deferral of the project for inclusion in the next Military Construction Authorization Act would be inconsistent with national security or national interest.

(b) When a decision is made to carry out a military construction project under this section, the Secretary of Defense shall submit a report to the appropriate committees of Congress on that decision. Each such report shall include the justification for the project, the current estimate of the cost of the project, and the justification for carrying out the project under this section. The project may then be carried out only after the end of the seven-day period beginning on the date the notification is received by such committees in an electronic medium pursuant to section 480 of this title.

"(3) The United States has no intention of using the construction after the operational requirements have been satisfied.

"(4) The level of construction is the minimum necessary to meet the temporary operational requirements.

"(b) Notification of Obligation of Funds.—Before using appropriated funds available for operation and maintenance to carry out a construction project outside the United States that has an estimated cost in excess of the amounts authorized for unspecified minor military construction projects under section 2805(c) of title 10, United States Code, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional committees specified in subsection (d) a notice regarding the construction project. The project may be carried out only after the end of the 14-day period beginning on the date the notice is received by the committees, including when a copy of the notification is provided in an electronic medium pursuant to section 480 of title 10, United States Code. The notice shall include the following:

"(1) Certification that the conditions specified in subsection (a) are satisfied with regard to the construction project.

"(2) A description of the purpose for which appropriated funds available for operation and maintenance are being obligated.

"(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the Secretary of Defense may authorize the obligation under this section of not more than an additional $10,000,000 of appropriated funds available for operation and maintenance for a fiscal year if the Secretary determines that the additional funds are needed for costs associated with contract closeouts.

"(3) The total amount of operation and maintenance funds used for a single construction project carried out under the authority of this section shall not exceed $15,000,000. The Secretary of Defense may waive this limitation on a project-by-project basis. This waiver authority may not be delegated.
