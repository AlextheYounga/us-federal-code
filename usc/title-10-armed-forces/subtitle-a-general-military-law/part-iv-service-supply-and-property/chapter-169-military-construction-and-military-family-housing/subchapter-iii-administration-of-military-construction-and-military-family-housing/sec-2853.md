(a) Cost Variations Authorized; Limitation.—Except as provided in subsection (c), (d), or (e), the cost authorized for a military construction project or for the construction, improvement, and acquisition of a military family housing project may be increased or decreased by not more than 25 percent of the total authorized cost of the project or 200 percent of the minor construction project ceiling specified in section 2805(a) of this title, whichever is less, if the Secretary concerned determines that such revised cost is required for the sole purpose of meeting unusual variations in cost and that such variations in cost could not have reasonably been anticipated at the time the project was authorized by Congress.

(b) Scope of Work Variations Authorized; Limitation.—(1) Except as provided in subsection (c), the scope of work for a military construction project or for the construction, improvement, and acquisition of a military family housing project may be reduced by not more than 25 percent from the amount specified for that project, construction, improvement, or acquisition in the justification data provided to Congress as part of the request for authorization of the project, construction, improvement, or acquisition. Any reduction in scope of work for a military construction project shall not result in a facility or item of infrastructure that is not complete and useable or does not fully meet the mission requirement contained in the justification data provided to Congress as part of the request for authorization of the project, construction, improvement, or acquisition.

(2) Except as provided in subsection (d), the scope of work for a military construction project or for the construction, improvement, and acquisition of a military family housing project may not be increased above the amount specified for that project, construction, improvement, or acquisition in the justification data provided to Congress as part of the request for authorization of the project, construction, improvement, or acquisition.

(3) In this subsection, the term "scope of work" refers to the function, size, or quantity of a facility or item of complete and useable infrastructure contained in the justification data provided to Congress as part of the request for authorization of the project, construction, improvement, or acquisition.

(B) The notification required by subparagraph (A) shall—

(i) identify the amount of the cost increase and the reasons for the increase;

(ii) certify that the cost increase is sufficient to meet the mission requirement identified in the justification data provided to Congress as part of the request for authorization of the project; and

(iii) describe the funds proposed to be used to finance the cost increase.

(C) A waiver and approval by the Secretary concerned under subparagraph (A) shall take effect only after the end of the 14-day period beginning on the date on which the notification required by such subparagraph is received by the appropriate committees of Congress in an electronic medium pursuant to section 480 of this title.

(ii) to approve an increase in the cost authorized for the project that would increase the project cost by more than 50 percent of the total authorized cost of the project.

(E) In addition to the notification required by this paragraph, subsection (f) applies whenever a military construction project or military family housing project with a total authorized cost greater than $40,000,000 will have a cost increase of 25 percent or more. Subsection (f) may not be construed to authorize a cost increase in excess of the limitation imposed by subparagraph (D).

(2)(A) The Secretary concerned may waive the percentage or dollar cost limitation applicable to a military construction project or a military family housing project under subsection (a) and approve a decrease in the cost authorized for the project in excess of that limitation if the Secretary concerned notifies the appropriate committees of Congress of the cost decrease not later than 14 days after the date funds are obligated in connection with the project.

(B) The notification required by subparagraph (A) shall be provided in an electronic medium pursuant to section 480 of this title.

(3)(A) The Secretary concerned may waive the limitation on a reduction in the scope of work applicable to a military construction project or a military family housing project under subsection (b)(1) and approve a scope of work reduction for the project in excess of that limitation if the Secretary concerned notifies the appropriate committees of Congress of the reduction in the manner provided in this paragraph.

(B) The notification required by subparagraph (A) shall—

(i) describe the reduction in the scope of work and the reasons for the decrease; and

(ii) certify that the mission requirement identified in the justification data provided to Congress can still be met with the reduced scope.

(C) A waiver and approval by the Secretary concerned under subparagraph (A) shall take effect only after the end of the 14-day period beginning on the date on which the notification required by such subparagraph is received by the appropriate committees of Congress in an electronic medium pursuant to section 480 of this title.

(4) The Secretary concerned may not use the authority provided by paragraph (1) to waive the limitation on an increase in the scope of work applicable to a military construction project or a military family housing project and approve an increase in the scope of work for the project that would increase the scope of work by more than 10 percent of the amount specified for the project in the justification data provided to Congress as part of the request for authorization of the project.
