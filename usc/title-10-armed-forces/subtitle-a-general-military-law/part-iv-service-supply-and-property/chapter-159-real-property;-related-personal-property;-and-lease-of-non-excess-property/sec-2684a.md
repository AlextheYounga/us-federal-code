Any such payment by the United States—

(A) may be paid in a lump sum and include an amount intended to cover the future costs of natural resource management and monitoring and enforcement; and

(B) may be placed by the eligible entity in an interest-bearing account, and any interest shall be applied for the same purposes as the principal.

(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), if all or a portion of the property or interest acquired under the agreement is initially or subsequently transferred to a State or another Federal agency, before that State or other Federal agency may declare the property or interest in excess to its needs or propose to exchange the property or interest, the State or other Federal agency shall give the Secretary concerned reasonable advance notice of its intent. If the Secretary concerned determines it necessary to preserve the purposes of this section, the Secretary concerned may request that administrative jurisdiction over the property be transferred to the Secretary concerned at no cost, and, upon such a request being made, the administrative jurisdiction over the property shall be transferred accordingly. If the Secretary concerned does not make such a request within a reasonable time period, all such rights of the Secretary concerned to request transfer of the property or interest shall remain available to the Secretary concerned with respect to future transfers or exchanges of the property or interest and shall bind all subsequent transferees.
