As originally enacted, Pub. L. 116–283, div. A, title XVIII, §1849(b)–(k), Jan. 1, 2021, 134 Stat. 4259–4264, transferred individual subsecs. of this section to section 4350 et seq. of this title, and section 1849(l) of Pub. L. 116–283 subsequently repealed this section. Pub. L. 117–81, div. A, title XVII, §1701(o)(1)–(5), Dec. 27, 2021, 135 Stat. 2146, 2147, amended section 1849 of Pub. L. 116–283, effective as if included therein, so that the individual transfers were eliminated and this section was transferred as a whole to section 4351 of this title. However, the repeal of this section by section 1849(l) (which was redesignated as section 1849(e)) of Pub. L. 116–283 was not eliminated and therefore could not be executed given the transfer of this section to section 4351 of this title.
