"(A) Assessment of foci.—(i) A requirement for covered contractors or subcontractors to disclose to the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency, or its successor organization, their beneficial ownership and whether they are under FOCI.

"(iii) modification of policies, directives, and practices to provide that an assessment that a covered contractor or subcontractor is under FOCI may be a sufficient basis for a contracting officer to determine that such a covered contractor or subcontractor is not responsible.

"(C) Contract requirements, administration, and oversight relating to foci.—

"(i) Requirements for contract clauses providing for and enforcing disclosures related to changes in FOCI or beneficial ownership during performance of the contract or subcontract, consistent with subparagraph (A), and necessitating the effective mitigation of risks related to FOCI throughout the duration of the contract or subcontract.

"(iii) A requirement for the provision of additional information regarding beneficial ownership and control of any covered contractor or subcontractor on the contract or subcontract.

"(iv) Procedures for appropriately responding to changes in covered contractor or subcontractor beneficial ownership status based on changes in disclosures of their beneficial ownership and whether they are under FOCI and the reports and examinations required by subparagraph (A)(v).

"(2) Research and development and procurement activities.—The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that the requirements of this section are applied to research and development and procurement activities, including for the delivery of services, established through any means including those under section 2358(b) of title 10, United States Code [now 10 U.S.C. 4001(b)].
