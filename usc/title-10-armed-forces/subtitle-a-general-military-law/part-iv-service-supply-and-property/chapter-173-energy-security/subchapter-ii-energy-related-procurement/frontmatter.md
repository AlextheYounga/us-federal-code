"(2) Notice to congress.—Upon the selection of each facility under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees notice of the selection, including an identification of the facility selected.

"(c) Use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel.—

"(1) Plans.—For each facility selected under subsection (b), not later than one year after the selection of the facility, the Secretary shall—

"(A) develop a plan on how to implement, by September 30, 2028, a target of exclusively using at the facility aviation fuel that is blended to contain not less than 10 percent sustainable aviation fuel;

"(B) submit the plan developed under subparagraph (A) to the appropriate congressional committees; and

"(C) provide to the appropriate congressional committees a briefing on such plan that includes, at a minimum—
