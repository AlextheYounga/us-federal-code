The words "active list" are inserted so that this section will apply only to officers of the Regular Navy holding permanent appointments in grades above commissioned warrant officer, as this was the intent of the source statute. The words "same grade" are substituted for the words "corresponding rank and grade" in subsection (a) and for the words "corresponding grade" in subsection (b), since, under §405 of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 (34 U.S.C. 10a), the grades in the staff corps are the same as those in the line. The words "transfer and" and "transferred and" are omitted as surplusage.

In subsection (a) the words "and precedence in the line" are omitted as surplusage.

In subsection (b) reference to the Construction Corps is omitted because that corps was abolished by the Act of June 25, 1940, ch. 420, §1, 54 Stat. 528.

The word "male" is inserted in both subsections to limit their application to men. Authority to appoint women is covered in §5590 of this title.
