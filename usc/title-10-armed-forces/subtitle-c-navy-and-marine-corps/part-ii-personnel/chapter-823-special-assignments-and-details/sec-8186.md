In subsection (a) the words "To promote" are substituted for the words "For the purposes of promoting" for brevity and the words "among the young men of the United States" are omitted as surplusage. The words "naval engineering" are substituted for the words "steam engineering" and the words "naval architecture" are substituted for the words "iron-ship building" to conform to current terminology and to express more clearly the intent of the statute. The words "the Territories, Commonwealths, or possessions" are inserted, since the words "United States" in the source statute are considered to have included all areas under the United States flag.

Section 1 of the Act of March 3, 1899, ch. 413, 30 Stat. 1004, transferred officers of the Engineer Corps of the Navy to the line of the Navy; therefore, in subsection (a) the words "qualified officer" are substituted for the words "engineer officer" to preserve the meaning of the section and to include any officer possessing adequate background and training in engineering duties.

In subsection (b) the word "regulations" is substituted for the word "rules", and the words "public interest" are substituted for the words "public service" to conform to current terminology.
