In subsection (a) the words "In addition \* \* \* to the number of rear admirals and above authorized by titles I, II, and III and by section 413 of this Act, a total of" are omitted as surplusage.

Retired officers are excluded from the lineal lists and are not counted for any purpose in the computations under the cited titles and section. The source text does not affect the authorized numbers so computed; it sets up an authorized number for a category of officers not previously covered.

The limitation on reserve flag officers on active duty contained in section 430 of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 was repealed by section 702(a) of the Reserve Officer Personnel Act of 1954.
