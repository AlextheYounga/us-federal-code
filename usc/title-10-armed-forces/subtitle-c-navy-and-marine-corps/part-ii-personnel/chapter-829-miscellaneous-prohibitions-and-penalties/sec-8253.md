### §8253. Loans: Supply Corps officers ###

Except as otherwise provided by law, an officer in the Supply Corps on active duty may not advance or lend any sum of money, public or private, or any article or commodity and may not extend credit to any officer of the naval service on active duty.

(Aug. 10, 1956, ch. 1041, 70A Stat. 381, §6113; renumbered §8253, Pub. L. 115–232, div. A, title VIII, §807(b)(9), Aug. 13, 2018, 132 Stat. 1835.)

The words "paymaster, passed assistant paymaster, or assistant paymaster" are omitted because those titles no longer exist, and the words "officer in the Supply Corps" are substituted therefor.

The words "except as otherwise provided by law" are added because the Act of Oct. 5, 1949, ch. 600 (34 U.S.C. 875a), authorizes advances of pay to personnel upon permanent changes of station or where such personnel are on distant duty stations where disbursements of pay and allowances cannot be regularly made, and §303(a) of the Career Compensation Act of 1949 (37 U.S.C. 253) authorizes advance payments of travel and transportation allowances. The words "on active duty" are supplied since the section has application to officers accountable for public funds or property. Officers not on active duty are not accountable officers.
