The word "award" is substituted for the word "present" to cover the determination of the recipient as well as the actual presenting of the decoration. The words "but not in the name of Congress" are omitted as surplusage, since a decoration is presented in the name of Congress only if the law so directs. The proviso of the first sentence of 34 U.S.C. 364a is omitted as executed. The words "Navy or the Marine Corps" are substituted for the words "United States Navy" because the provision is interpreted as authorizing the award of the decoration to persons serving with the Marine Corps as well as with the Navy. The words "and notwithstanding the provisions of section 14 of this Act," which are not now contained in title 34, are omitted as unnecessary. The words "since the 6th day of April, 1917, has distinguished, or who, after July 2, 1926," are omitted as executed.
