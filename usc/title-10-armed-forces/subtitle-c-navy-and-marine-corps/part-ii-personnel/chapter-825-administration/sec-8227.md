(1) The name and hull number of the ship.

(2) The homeport location of the ship.

(4) If the lowest level of manning fit or manning fill for the ship occurred during the fiscal year quarter concerned, the level concerned and the date on which such level occurred.

(5) If the lowest level of manning fit or manning fill for the ship is projected to occur after the fiscal year quarter concerned, the projected level and the date on which such level is projected to occur.

(6) If not achieved as of the date of the notification the projected date on which the Navy will achieve a manning fit and fill at least 87 percent and 90 percent, respectively, for the ship.

(7) If not achieved as of the date of the notification, the projected date on which the Navy will achieve a manning fit and fill of at least 92 percent and 95 percent, respectively, for the ship.

(8) A description of the reasons the Navy has not achieved, or will not achieve, as applicable, manning fit and fill of at least 87 percent and 90 percent, respectively, for the ship, including a detailed description of the specific ratings or skillset areas that must be manned to achieve those percentages.

(9) A description of corrective actions the Navy is taking to improve manning fit or manning fill on the ship.

(c) Special Rule.—For purposes of determining whether a percentage of manning fit or manning fill has been achieved, a sailor in a more senior paygrade may count as filling the billet of a more junior paygrade, but a sailor in a more junior paygrade may not count as filling the billet of a more senior paygrade.

(d) Crewing of a Surface Combatant Vessel: Prohibition; Exception.—(1) Beginning on October 1, 2025, the Secretary of the Navy may not assign more than one crew to a covered ship that is a surface combatant vessel if any surface combatant vessel was included in a notification under subsection (a) during the 12 months preceding such assignment.

(2) The prohibition under paragraph (1) shall not apply to a littoral combat ship configured to conduct mine countermeasures if the Secretary of the Navy submits to the congressional defense committees a certification and detailed explanation that such ship is unable to meet operational requirements regarding mine countermeasures, determined by the commander of a combatant command concerned, with only one crew.
