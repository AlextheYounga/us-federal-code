The proviso to the effect that the section does not affect the responsibility of the Secretary of the Navy under 34 U.S.C. 732 is omitted as unnecessary. The words "as may, in his judgment, be necessary" are omitted as surplusage. The words "members of the naval service" are substituted for "naval aviators" to avoid the implication that trainees are naval aviators while undergoing the training. The designation depends on successful completion of flight training.
