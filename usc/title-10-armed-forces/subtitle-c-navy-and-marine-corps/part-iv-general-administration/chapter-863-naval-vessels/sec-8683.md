### §8683. Ship overhaul work: availability of appropriations for unusual cost overruns and for changes in scope of work ###

(a) Unusual Cost Overruns.—(1) Appropriations available to the Department of Defense for a fiscal year may be used for payment of unusual cost overruns incident to ship overhaul, maintenance, and repair for a vessel inducted into an industrial-fund activity or contracted for during a prior fiscal year.

(2) The Secretary of Defense shall notify Congress promptly before an obligation is incurred for any payment under paragraph (1).

(b) Changes in Scope of Work.—An appropriation available to the Department of Defense for a fiscal year may be used after the otherwise-applicable expiration of the availability for obligation of that appropriation—

(1) for payments to an industrial-fund activity for amounts required because of changes in the scope of work for ship overhaul, maintenance, and repair, in the case of work inducted into the industrial-fund activity during the fiscal year; and

(2) for payments under a contract for amounts required because of changes in the scope of work, in the case of a contract entered into during the fiscal year for ship overhaul, maintenance, and repair.

(c) Treatment of Amounts Appropriated After End of Period of Obligation.—In the application of section 1553(c) of title 31 to funds appropriated in the Operation and Maintenance, Navy account that are available for ship overhaul, the Secretary of the Navy may treat the limitation specified in paragraph (1) of such section to be "$10,000,000" rather than "$4,000,000".

#### Historical and Revision Notes ####

Section is based on Pub. L. 99–190, §101(b) [title VIII, §8005(j), (k)], Dec. 19, 1985, 99 Stat. 1185, 1203.

In two instances, the source law to be codified by the bill includes provisions that on their face require that the Department of Defense notify Congress of certain actions. These notification requirements were terminated by section 602 of the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 (Public Law 99–433), which terminated all recurring reporting requirements applicable to the Department of Defense except for those requirements that were specifically exempted in that section. The source law sections are sections 8009(c) and 8005(j) (proviso) of the FY86 defense appropriations Act (Public Law 99–190), enacted December 19, 1985, which would be codified as section 2201 of title 10 (by section 1(d) of the bill) and section 7313(a) of title 10 (by section 1(n) of the bill). In codifying the authorities provided the Department of Defense by these two provisions of law, the committee believes that it is appropriate to reinstate the congressional notification requirements that go with those authorities. These sections were recurring annual appropriation provisions for many years and were made permanent only months before the enactment of the 1986 Reorganization Act. It is the committee's belief that the failure to exempt these provisions from the general reports termination provision was inadvertent and notes that the notification provisions had in fact previously applied to the Department of Defense for many years. The action of the committee restores the status quo as it existed before the Reorganization Act.
