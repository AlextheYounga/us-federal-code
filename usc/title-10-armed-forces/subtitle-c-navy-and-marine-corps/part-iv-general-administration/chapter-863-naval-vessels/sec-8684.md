### §8684. Overhaul of naval vessels: competition between public and private shipyards ###

The Secretary of the Navy should ensure, in any case in which the Secretary awards a project for repair, alteration, overhaul, or conversion of a naval vessel following competition between public and private shipyards, that each of the following criteria is met:

(1) The bid of any public shipyard for the award includes—

(A) the full costs to the United States associated with future retirement benefits of civilian employees of that shipyard consistent with computation methodology established by Office of Management and Budget Circular A–76; and

(B) in a case in which equal access to the Navy supply system is not allowed to public and private shipyards, a pro rata share of the costs of the Navy supply system.

(2) Costs applicable to oversight of the contract by the appropriate Navy supervisor of shipbuilding, conversion, and repair are added to the bid of any private shipyard for the purpose of comparability analysis.

(3) The award is made using the results of the comparability analysis.
