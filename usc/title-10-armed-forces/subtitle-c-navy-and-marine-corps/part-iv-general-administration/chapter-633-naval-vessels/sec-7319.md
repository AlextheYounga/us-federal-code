### §7319. Requirements for availability of funds relating to advanced naval nuclear fuel systems based on low-enriched uranium ###

(a) Authorization.—Low-enriched uranium activities may only be carried out using funds authorized to be appropriated or otherwise made available for the Department of Energy for atomic energy defense activities for defense nuclear nonproliferation.

(b) Prohibition Regarding Certain Accounts.—(1) None of the funds described in paragraph (2) may be obligated or expended to carry out low-enriched uranium activities.

A provision of law, including a table incorporated into an Act, that appropriates funds described in paragraph (2) for low-enriched uranium activities may not be treated as specifically superseding this section unless such provision specifically cites to this section.

(c) Low-enriched Uranium Activities Defined.—In this section, the term "low-enriched uranium activities" means the following:

(1) Planning or carrying out research and development of an advanced naval nuclear fuel system based on low-enriched uranium.

(2) Procuring ships that use low-enriched uranium in naval nuclear propulsion reactors.
