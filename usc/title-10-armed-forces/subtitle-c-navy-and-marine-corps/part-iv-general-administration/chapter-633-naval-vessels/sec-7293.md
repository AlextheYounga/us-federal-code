The words “vessels of the Navy” are substituted for the words “of the public armed vessels”. The words “actual”, “in his opinion”, and “by the nature of the service” are omitted as surplusage. The words “in reserve” are substituted for the words “to be laid up in ordinary in convenient ports” to conform to modern terminology.
