### §8867. Transfer of prize property to another district for sale ###

(a) In the case of any prize property ordered to be sold, if the court believes that it will be in the interest of all parties to have the property sold in a judicial district other than the one in which the proceedings are pending, the court may direct the marshal to transfer the property to the district selected by the court for the sale, and to insure it. In such a case the court shall give the marshal proper orders as to the time and manner of conducting the sale.

(b) When so ordered the marshal shall transfer the property and keep it safely. He is responsible for its sale in the same manner as if the property were in his own district and for the deposit of the gross proceeds with the Treasurer of the United States or public depositary nearest to the place of sale, subject to the order of the court for the district where the adjudication is pending.

(c) The necessary expenses of insuring, transferring, receiving, keeping, and selling the property are a charge upon it and upon the proceeds. Whenever any such expense is paid in advance by the marshal, any amount not repaid to him from the proceeds shall be allowed to him as in the case of expenses incurred in suits in which the United States is a party.

(d) If the Secretary of the Navy believes that it will be in the interest of all parties to have the property sold in a judicial district other than the one in which the proceedings are pending, he may, either by a general regulation or by a special direction in the cause, require the marshal to transfer the property from the district in which the judicial proceedings are pending to any other district for sale. In such a case proceedings shall be had as if the transfer had been made by order of the court.

34 U.S.C. 1145 and this section reflect the Act of May 29, 1920, ch. 214, §1, 41 Stat. 654, which requires substitution of "Treasurer of the United States or public depositary" for "assistant treasurer".

In subsection (b) the words "He is responsible for its sale" are substituted for the words "It shall be the duty of the marshal to \* \* \* sell the same", because, as shown in §7666 of this title, the marshal does not sell the property himself but supervises the auctioneer who conducts the sale.
