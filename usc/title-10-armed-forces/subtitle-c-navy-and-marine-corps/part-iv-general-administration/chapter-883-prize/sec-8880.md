34 U.S.C. 1146 and this section reflect—

(1) Acts of March 3, 1911, ch. 231, §128, 36 Stat. 1133, and February 13, 1925, ch. 229, §1, 43 Stat. 938, which defined the appellate jurisdiction of the United States Circuit Courts of Appeals; and

(2) Act of June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 869, which repealed the 1911 and 1925 Acts, but enacted similar provisions and changed the name of the circuit courts to United States Courts of Appeals for the several circuits.

The words "or of intention to appeal" are omitted as surplusage. Formerly "notices of appeal" were filed in some courts and "notices of intention to appeal" were filed in others. The difference was in terminology, not in substance. These notices are now known as "notices of appeal". The words "next" and "the rendition of" are omitted as surplusage.
