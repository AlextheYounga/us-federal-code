(Aug. 10, 1956, ch. 1041, 70A Stat. 429, §6953; Pub. L. 97–60, title II, §203(b)(1), Oct. 14, 1981, 95 Stat. 1006; renumbered §8453, Pub. L. 115–232, div. A, title VIII, §807(c)(1), Aug. 13, 2018, 132 Stat. 1836.)

#### Historical and Revision Notes ####

This section is included in this chapter without specific reference to statutory source to resolve the ambiguities and conflicts existing in the statutes relating to the appointment of midshipmen at the Naval Academy. The word "appoint" has been used in various statutes when the intent of Congress was to provide authority in the persons named to "choose," "select," or "nominate" for the office of midshipman. These statutes have been collected and codified in §6954 of this title, which reflects the various sources of nominees for "appointment" as midshipmen and the persons who may so "nominate" them. The actual appointing power resides in the President and this implied authority is herein expressed for clarity and for the purpose of uniformity of expression.
