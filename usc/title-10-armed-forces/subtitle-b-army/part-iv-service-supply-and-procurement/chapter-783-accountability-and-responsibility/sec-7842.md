### §7842. Settlement of accounts of line officers ###

The Comptroller General shall settle the account of a line officer of the Army for pay due the officer even if the officer cannot account for property entrusted to the officer or cannot make a monthly report or return, when the Comptroller General is satisfied that the inability to account for property or make a report or return was the result of the officer having been a prisoner, or of an accident or casualty of war.
