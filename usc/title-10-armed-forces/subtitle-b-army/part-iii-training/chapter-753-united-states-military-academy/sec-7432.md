### §7432. Departments and professors: titles ###

(a) The Secretary of the Army may prescribe the titles of each of the departments of instruction and the professors of the Academy. However, the change of the title of a department or officer does not affect the status, rank, or eligibility for promotion or retirement of, or otherwise prejudice, a professor at the Academy.

(b) Upon becoming the senior professor in a department, a permanent professor thereby becomes the head of that department.
