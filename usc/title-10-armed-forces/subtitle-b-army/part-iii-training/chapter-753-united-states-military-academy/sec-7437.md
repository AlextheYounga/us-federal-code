The words "The chaplain may be reappointed" are substituted for the words "and said chaplain shall be eligible for reappointment for an additional term or terms". The figures "$5,482.80" and "$6,714" are substituted for the figures "$4,000" and "$5,000" to reflect increases in the rates of salary of that office effected by the Federal Employees Pay Act of 1945, 59 Stat. 295, the Federal Employees Pay Act of 1946, 60 Stat. 216, the Postal Rate Revision and Federal Employees Salary Act of 1948, 62 Stat. 1260, and the Classification Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 954.

#### 1962 Act ####

The change reflects the opinion of the Assistant General Counsel, Civil Service Commission (GC: JHF:fz, May 4, 1959), that those parts of section 4337 and 9337 of title 10 that relate to the salaries of the chaplains at the United States Military Academy and the United States Air Force Academy were superseded by the Classification Act of 1949 (5 U.S.C. 1071 et seq.). While the positions of chaplain at those Academies are not specifically covered by the Act, the Act has been determined to apply to those positions in accordance with section 203 thereof (5 U.S.C. 1083).
