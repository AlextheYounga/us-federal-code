The words "buy and issue all provisions for the mess" and "supervise the mess" are substituted for the words "all the duties of purveying and supervision for the mess". The word "commissary" is omitted as obsolete. The words "and all supplies of all kinds and descriptions shall be furnished to the cadets at actual cost, without any commission or advance over said cost" are omitted to reflect Title IV of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended (61 Stat. 495), which authorized the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations governing the use and sale of certain inventories at cost, including applicable administrative expenses.
