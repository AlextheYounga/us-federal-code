(a) For the purpose of determining whether an enlisted member of the Army may be retired under section 7314 or 7317 of this title, his years of service are computed by adding all active service in the armed forces and service computed under section 3683 <sup><a href="#7325_1_target" name="7325_1">1</a></sup> of this title.

(b) Time required to be made up under section 972(a) of this title may not be counted in determining years of service under subsection (a).

(Aug. 10, 1956, ch. 1041, 70A Stat. 228, §3925; Pub. L. 85–861, §1(97), Sept. 2, 1958, 72 Stat. 1488; Pub. L. 96–343, §9(a)(2), Sept. 8, 1980, 94 Stat. 1128; Pub.

In subsection (a), the words "active service" are substituted for the word "service", in 10:947, and "active Federal service performed", in 10:958, for uniformity. The words "service computed under section 3683 of this title" are inserted, since a person entitled to count service under that revised section might cease to be a nurse or woman medical specialist and thereafter become entitled to retire under one of the revised sections referred to in subsection (a) of this revised section.

Subsection (b) is inserted because of section 3638 of this title and in accordance with long-standing interpretation of the effect of 10:629 upon the computation of years of service for retirement.

The amendment reflects the repeal of section 3638 of this title and the enactment of a similar provision in section 972 of this title.
