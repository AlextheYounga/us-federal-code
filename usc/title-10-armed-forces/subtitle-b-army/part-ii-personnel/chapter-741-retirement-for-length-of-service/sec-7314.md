The words "now or hereafter", in 10:948a, are omitted as surplusage. The words "computed under section 3925 of this title" are substituted for the words "active Federal service", in 10:948, and "active Federal military service", in 10:948a, since that revised section makes explicit the service covered. The words "be retired" are substituted for the words "will be placed on the retired list of", in 10:948. The words "completed a minimum", in 10:948; and "the period of", "be subject to", "periods of", and "now or after August 10, 1946", in 10:948a; are omitted as surplusage.
