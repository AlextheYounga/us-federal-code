The words "but not in the name of Congress" are omitted as surplusage, since a medal is presented in the name of Congress only if the law so directs. The words "since the 6th day of April, 1917" are omitted as executed. The word "award" is substituted for the word "present" to cover the determination of the recipients as well as the actual presentation of the medal, and to conform to other sections of this chapter. The words "or herself" are omitted, since, under section 1 of title 1, words importing the masculine gender include the feminine. The words "or who shall distinguish" are omitted as surplusage.
