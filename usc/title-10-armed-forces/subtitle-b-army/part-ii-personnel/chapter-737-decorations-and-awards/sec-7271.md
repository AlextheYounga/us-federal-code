The words "That the provisions of existing law relating to the award of medals of honor to officers, noncommissioned officers, and privates of the Army be, and they hereby are, amended so that", in the Act of July 9, 1918, ch. 143 (8th par. under "Ordnance Department"), 40 Stat. 870, are not contained in 10:1403. They are also omitted from the revised section as surplusage. The word "member" is substituted for the words "officer or enlisted man". The word "only" is omitted as surplusage. The word "award" is inserted for clarity, since the President determines the recipient of the medal in addition to presenting it.
