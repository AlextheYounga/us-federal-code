### §9280. Airman's Medal: award; limitations ###

(a)(1) The President may award a decoration called the "Airman's Medal", of appropriate design with accompanying ribbon, to any person who, while serving in any capacity with the Air Force, distinguishes himself by heroism not involving actual conflict with an enemy.

(2) The authority in paragraph (1) includes authority to award the medal to a member of the Ready Reserve who was not in a duty status defined in section 101(d) of this title when the member distinguished himself by heroism.

(b) Not more than one Airman's Medal may be awarded to a person. However, for each succeeding act that would otherwise justify the award of such a medal, the President may award a suitable bar or other device to be worn as he directs.

The words "Under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe" are omitted, since the President has inherent authority to issue regulations appropriate to exercising his functions. The words "but not in the name of Congress" are omitted as surplusage, since a medal is presented in the name of Congress only if the law so directs. The word "award" is substituted for the word "present" to cover the determination of the recipients as well as the actual presentation of the medal. The words "a decoration called" are substituted for the words "a medal to be known as". The words "including the National Guard and the Organized Reserves" are omitted as surplusage. The words "or herself" are omitted, since, under section 1 of title 1, words importing the masculine gender include the feminine. The words "after July 2, 1926" are omitted as executed.

In subsection (b), the words "that would otherwise justify" are substituted for the words "sufficient to".
