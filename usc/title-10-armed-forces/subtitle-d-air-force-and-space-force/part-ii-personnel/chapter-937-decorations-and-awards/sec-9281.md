In subsection (a), the words "authorized for members of the Air Force after September 26, 1947" are substituted for the words "hereafter authorized", since, under Transfer Order 1, that date was the effective date of the transfer of personnel from the Army to the Air Force under section 208(e) of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended (5 U.S.C. 626c(e)). 10:1415a (proviso) is omitted as surplusage, since the revised section is not limited to persons who are members of the Air Force at the time of the issue.

In subsection (b), the words "member of the Air Force" are substituted for the words "persons in the military service of the United States".

In subsection (c), the last 16 words are substituted for 10:1415c (last 16 words).
