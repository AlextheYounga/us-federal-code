### §9279. Distinguished flying cross: award; limitations ###

(a) The President may award a distinguished flying cross of appropriate design with accompanying ribbon to any person who, while serving in any capacity with the Air Force, distinguishes himself by heroism or extraordinary achievement while participating in an aerial flight.

(b) Not more than one distinguished flying cross may be awarded to a person. However, for each succeeding act that would otherwise justify the award of such a cross, the President may award a suitable bar or other device to be worn as he directs.

In subsection (a), the words "under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe" are omitted, since the President has inherent authority to issue regulations appropriate to exercising his functions. The words "but not in the name of Congress" are omitted as surplusage, since a medal is presented in the name of Congress only if the law so directs. The word "award" is substituted for the word "present" to cover the determination of the recipients as well as the actual presentation of the medal. The words "since the 6th day of April, 1917, has distinguished, or who, after July 2, 1926" and 10:1429 (proviso of 1st sentence) are omitted as executed.
