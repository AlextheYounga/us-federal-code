In subsection (a), the words "members of the Air Force" are substituted for the words "officers and soldiers".

In subsection (b), the words "regiments, hospitals, and posts", in 10:239, are omitted, since at the time of the enactment of section 1127 of the Revised Statutes, chaplains were authorized only for regiments, hospitals, and posts. The revised section preserves the broad coverage of the original statute. The words "each commanding officer shall" are substituted for the words "It shall be the duty of commanders", in 10:239. The word "furnish" is substituted for the words "to afford", in 10:239. The words "including necessary transportation" are substituted for the last sentence of section 12 of the Act of February 2, 1901, ch. 192, 31 Stat. 750. The words "his command" are substituted for the words "the same", in 10:239. The words "to assist" are substituted for the words "as may aid them", in 10:239.
