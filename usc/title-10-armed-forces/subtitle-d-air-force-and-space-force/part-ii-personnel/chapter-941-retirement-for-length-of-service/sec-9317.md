The word "regular" is inserted to conform to an opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAGA 1953/2301, 23 Mar. 1953). The words "upon his request" are substituted for the words "upon making application to the President", in 10:947, and "by application to the President", in 10:947a. The words "either as a private or non-commissioned officer, or both", in 10:947a, are omitted as surplusage. The words "shall be retired" are substituted for the words "be placed upon the retired list", in 10:947, and "be placed on the retired list heretofore created", in 10:947a. The words "computed under section 8925 of this title" are inserted for clarity. The 21 words before the proviso and the proviso of the Act of February 14, 1885, as restated, are not contained in 10:947a. They are also omitted from the revised section, since the proviso is executed and the 21 words before the proviso are omitted as covered by formula E of section 8991 of this title.
