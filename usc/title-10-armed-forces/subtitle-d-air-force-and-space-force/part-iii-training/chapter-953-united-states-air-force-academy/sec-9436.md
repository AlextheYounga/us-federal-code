(a) A permanent professor of the Academy who is the head of a department of instruction, or who has served as such a professor for more than six years, has the grade of colonel in the Air Force or the equivalent grade in the Space Force. However, a permanent professor appointed from the Regular Air Force has the grade of colonel and a permanent professor appointed from the Regular Space Force has the grade equivalent to the grade of colonel in the Regular Air Force after the date when such person completes six years of service as a professor, or after the date on which such person would have been promoted had such person been selected for promotion from among officers in the promotion zone, whichever is earlier. All other permanent professors have the grade of lieutenant colonel in the Air Force or the equivalent grade in the Space Force.

(b) A person appointed as director of admissions of the Academy has the regular grade of lieutenant colonel in the Air Force or the equivalent grade in the Space Force, and, after such person has served six years as director of admissions, has the regular grade of colonel in the Air Force or the equivalent grade in the Space Force. However, a person appointed from the Regular Air Force has the regular grade of colonel and a person appointed from the Regular Space Force has the grade equivalent to the grade of colonel in the Regular Air Force after the date when such person completes six years of service as director of admissions, or after the date on which such person would have been promoted had such person been selected for promotion from among officers in the promotion zone, whichever is earlier.

|      9336       |    10:1079a(a).    |Aug. 7, 1947, ch. 512, §520(a) 61 Stat. 912.|

The word "grade" is substituted for the word "rank". The words "pay, and allowances" are omitted, since they are determined by the grade held. 10:1079a(a) (last proviso), and the words "Hereafter each of", "who have been or may hereafter be", and "and appointed in" are omitted as surplusage.

#### 1958 Act ####

The word "regular" is deleted [in sections 9335 and 9336] to make clear that a Dean or professor of the United States Air Force Academy holds only the office of "Dean" or "professor" and not the office of "brigadier general" or "colonel", as the case may be, even though he is entitled to the pay and allowances of that grade.

#### Amendments ####

**2021**—Pub. L. 116–283, §923(d)(9)(B), substituted "such person" for "he" wherever appearing.

Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 116–283, §923(d)(9)(A)(i), inserted "in the Air Force or the equivalent grade in the Space Force" after "grade of colonel", "and a permanent professor appointed from the Regular Space Force has the grade equivalent to the grade of colonel in the Regular Air Force" after "Force has the grade of colonel", and "in the Air Force or the equivalent grade in the Space Force" after "lieutenant colonel".
