|9335(a)<br/><br/>9335(b)|10:1089 (2d sentence).<br/><br/>10:1089 (less 1st 20 words, and less 2d sentence).|June 26, 1946, ch. 495, §3 (less 1st 20 words), 60 Stat. 312.|

In subsection (b), the word "grade" is substituted for the word "rank". The words "pay, allowances" are omitted, since they are determined by the grade held. The words "retirement rights" are omitted as covered by the word "benefits". The words "There is authorized", "from time to time", and "statutory" are omitted as surplusage. So much of 10:1089 as relates to the duties of the Dean of the Faculty is omitted as covered by section 8012(e) of this title.

#### 1958 Act ####

The word "regular" is deleted [in sections 9335 and 9336] to make clear that a Dean or professor of the United States Air Force Academy holds only the office of "Dean" or "professor" and not the office of "brigadier general" or "colonel", as the case may be, even though he is entitled to the pay and allowances of that grade.
