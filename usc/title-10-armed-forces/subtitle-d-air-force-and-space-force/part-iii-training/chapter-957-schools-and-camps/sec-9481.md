Pub. L. 116–283, §923(d)(16)(A), which directed amendment of this section by inserting ", the Space Force," after "members of the Air Force,", was executed by making the insertion after "members of the Air Force" to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

**2018**—Pub. L. 115–232 renumbered section 9411 of this title as this section.
