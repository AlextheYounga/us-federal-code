### §15303. Guaranteed minimum payment amount ###

#### (a) In general ####

In addition to any other payments made under this subchapter, the Administrator shall make a payment to each State to which a payment is made under either section 15301 or 15302 of this title and with respect to which the aggregate amount paid under such sections is less than $5,000,000 in an amount equal to the difference between the aggregate amount paid to the State under sections 15301 and 15302 of this title and $5,000,000. In the case of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, and the United States Virgin Islands, the previous sentence shall be applied as if each reference to "$5,000,000" were a reference to "$1,000,000".

#### (b) Pro rata reductions ####

The Administrator shall make such pro rata reductions to the amounts described in sections 15301(d) and 15302(c) of this title as are necessary to comply with the requirements of subsection (a) of this section.
