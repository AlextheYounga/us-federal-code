#### "SEC. 1801. OIL PIPELINE RATEMAKING METHODOLOGY. ####

"(a) Establishment.—Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act [Oct. 24, 1992], the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shall issue a final rule which establishes a simplified and generally applicable ratemaking methodology for oil pipelines in accordance with section 1(5) of part I of the Interstate Commerce Act [former 49 U.S.C. 1(5)].

"(b) Effective Date.—The final rule to be issued under subsection (a) may not take effect before the 365th day following the date of the issuance of the rule.

"(a) Rulemaking.—Not later than 18 months after the date of the enactment of this Act [Oct. 24, 1992], the Commission shall issue a final rule to streamline procedures of the Commission relating to oil pipeline rates in order to avoid unnecessary regulatory costs and delays.

"(b) Scope of Rulemaking.—Issues to be considered in the rulemaking proceeding to be conducted under subsection (a) shall include the following:

"(1) Identification of information to be filed with an oil pipeline tariff and the availability to the public of any analysis of such tariff filing performed by the Commission or its staff.

"(2) Qualification for standing (including definitions of economic interest) of parties who protest oil pipeline tariff filings or file complaints thereto.

"(3) The level of specificity required for a protest or complaint and guidelines for Commission action on the portion of the tariff or rate filing subject to protest or complaint.

"(4) An opportunity for the oil pipeline to file a response for the record to an initial protest or complaint.

"(5) Identification of specific circumstances under which Commission staff may initiate a protest.

"(c) Additional Procedural Changes.—In conducting the rulemaking proceeding to carry out subsection (a), the Commission shall identify and transmit to Congress any other procedural changes relating to oil pipeline rates which the Commission determines are necessary to avoid unnecessary regulatory costs and delays and for which additional legislative authority may be necessary.

"(d) Withdrawal of Tariffs and Complaints.—

"(1) Withdrawal of tariffs.—If an oil pipeline tariff which is filed under part I of the Interstate Commerce Act [former 49 U.S.C. 1 et seq.] and which is subject to investigation is withdrawn—

"(A) any proceeding with respect to such tariff shall be terminated;

"(B) the previous tariff rate shall be reinstated; and

"(C) any amounts collected under the withdrawn tariff rate which are in excess of the previous tariff rate shall be refunded.

"(2) Withdrawal of complaints.—If a complaint which is filed under section 13 of the Interstate Commerce Act [former 49 U.S.C. 13] with respect to an oil pipeline tariff is withdrawn, any proceeding with respect to such complaint shall be terminated.

"(e) Alternative Dispute Resolution.—To the maximum extent practicable, the Commission shall establish appropriate alternative dispute resolution procedures, including required negotiations and voluntary arbitration, early in an oil pipeline rate proceeding as a method preferable to adjudication in resolving disputes relating to the rate. Any proposed rates derived from implementation of such procedures shall be considered by the Commission on an expedited basis for approval.

#### "SEC. 1803. PROTECTION OF CERTAIN EXISTING RATES. ####

"(a) Rates Deemed Just and Reasonable.—Except as provided in subsection (b)—

"(1) any rate in effect for the 365-day period ending on the date of the enactment of this Act [Oct. 24, 1992] shall be deemed to be just and reasonable (within the meaning of section 1(5) of the Interstate Commerce Act [former 49 U.S.C. 1(5)]); and

"(2) any rate in effect on the 365th day preceding the date of such enactment shall be deemed to be just and reasonable (within the meaning of such section 1(5)) regardless of whether or not, with respect to such rate, a new rate has been filed with the Commission during such 365-day period;

if the rate in effect, as described in paragraph (1) or (2), has not been subject to protest, investigation, or complaint during such 365-day period.

"(b) Changed Circumstances.—No person may file a complaint under section 13 of the Interstate Commerce Act [former 49 U.S.C. 13] against a rate deemed to be just and reasonable under subsection (a) unless—

"(1) evidence is presented to the Commission which establishes that a substantial change has occurred after the date of the enactment of this Act [Oct. 24, 1992]—

"(A) in the economic circumstances of the oil pipeline which were a basis for the rate; or

"(B) in the nature of the services provided which were a basis for the rate; or

"(2) the person filing the complaint was under a contractual prohibition against the filing of a complaint which was in effect on the date of enactment of this Act and had been in effect prior to January 1, 1991, provided that a complaint by a party bound by such prohibition is brought within 30 days after the expiration of such prohibition.

If the Commission determines pursuant to a proceeding instituted as a result of a complaint under section 13 of the Interstate Commerce Act that the rate is not just and reasonable, the rate shall not be deemed to be just and reasonable. Any tariff reduction or refunds that may result as an outcome of such a complaint shall be prospective from the date of the filing of the complaint.

"(c) Limitation Regarding Unduly Discriminatory or Preferential Tariffs.—Nothing in this section shall prohibit any aggrieved person from filing a complaint under section 13 or section 15(l) of the Interstate Commerce Act [former 49 U.S.C. 13, 15(1)] challenging any tariff provision as unduly discriminatory or unduly preferential.
