### §19014. Expanding geographic and institutional diversity in research ###

#### (a) Continuing support for EPSCoR ####

#### (1) Sense of Congress ####

It is the sense of Congress that—

(A) because maintaining the Nation's scientific and economic leadership requires the participation of talented individuals nationwide, EPSCoR investments into State research and education capacities are in the Federal interest and should be sustained;

(B) EPSCoR should maintain its experimental component by supporting innovative methods for improving research capacity and competitiveness; and

(C) the Director should carry out this subsection while maintaining or increasing proposal success rates at emerging research institutions throughout the United States and without precluding access to awards for such institutions.

#### (2) Omitted ####

#### (3) Geographic diversity and inclusion ####

#### (A) In general ####

To the maximum extent practicable, not less than—

(i) 15.5 percent in fiscal year 2023,

(ii) 16 percent in fiscal year 2024,

(iii) 16.5 percent in fiscal year 2025,

(iv) 17 percent in fiscal year 2026,

(v) 18 percent in fiscal year 2027,

(vi) 19 percent in fiscal year 2028, and

(vii) 20 percent in fiscal year 2029,

(iv) an assessment of EPSCoR eligibility criteria and determination on whether new eligibility criteria should be developed based on the findings from clauses (i), (ii), and (iii); and

(v) a plan to sustain and grow improvements in research capacity and competitiveness in EPSCoR jurisdictions.

#### (H) EPSCoR eligibility ####

#### (i) In general ####

The Director shall ensure eligibility for current EPSCoR jurisdictions for five years from August 9, 2022, after which the Director shall determine whether new eligibility criteria should be developed based on the findings in the report required under subparagraph (G).

#### (ii) Report ####

Not later than December 31, 2028, the Director shall report to Congress regarding any new eligibility criteria determined under clause (i), any changes to jurisdictional eligibility based on such criteria, and the necessity and practicality of continuing or modifying the requirement under subparagraph (A) given any such changes to eligibility. The report shall include an analysis of options to support regions in non-EPSCoR jurisdictions, adjacent to EPSCoR jurisdictions, that historically receive disproportionately low levels of funding from the Foundation, including, if appropriate, options to expand the EPSCoR program or to establish new programs.

#### (b) Fostering STEM research diversity and capacity program ####

#### (1) In general ####
