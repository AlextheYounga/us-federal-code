(4) support the development of scientific, innovation, entrepreneurial, and STEM educational capacity within the region of the Regional Innovation Engine to grow and sustain regional innovation.

#### (c) Uses of funds ####

Funds awarded under this section may be used by a Regional Innovation Engine to—

(1) conduct use-inspired and translational research and technology development to advance innovation in at least one of the key technology focus areas and to help solve a compelling regional, national, societal, or geostrategic challenge;

(2) further the development, adoption, and commercialization of innovations in key technology focus areas, including through support for proof-of-concept development, and through partnership with other Federal agencies and Federal laboratories, industry, including startup companies, labor organizations, civil society organizations, and State, territorial, local, and Tribal governments;

(3) develop and manage, or facilitate access to, test beds and instrumentation, which may include fabrication facilities and cyberinfrastructure, to advance the development, integration, and demonstration of new, innovative technologies, including hardware or software;
