### §19084. Advanced computing ###

#### (a) Computing needs ####

To gather information about the computational needs of Foundation-funded projects, the Director shall require award proposals submitted to the Foundation, as appropriate, to include estimates of computational resource needs for projects that require use of advanced computing. The Director shall encourage and provide access to tools that facilitate the inclusion of these measures, including those identified in the 2016 National Academies report entitled "Future Directions for NSF Advanced Computing Infrastructure to Support U.S. Science and Engineering in 2017–2020".

#### (b) Reports ####

The Director shall document and publish every two years a summary of the amount and types of advanced computing capabilities that are needed to fully meet the Foundation's project needs as identified under subsection (a).

#### (c) Roadmap ####

To set priorities and guide strategic decisions regarding investments in advanced computing capabilities, the Director shall develop, publish, and regularly update a 5-year advanced computing roadmap that—

(1) describes the advanced computing resources and capabilities that would fully meet anticipated project needs, including through investments in the Mid-Scale Research Infrastructure program and the Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction account;

(2) draws on community input, information contained in research proposals, allocation requests, insights from Foundation-funded cyber-infrastructure operators, and Foundation-wide information gathering regarding community needs;

(3) considers computational needs of planned major facilities;

(4) reflects anticipated technology trends;

(5) informs users and potential partners about future facilities and services;

(6) addresses the needs of groups historically underrepresented in STEM and geographic regions with low availability and high demand for advanced computing resources;

(7) considers how Foundation-supported advanced computing capabilities can be leveraged for activities through the Directorate for Technology, Innovation, and Partnerships; and

(8) provides an update to Congress about the level of funding necessary to fully meet computational resource needs for the research community.

#### (d) Securing American research from cyber theft ####

#### (1) Omitted ####

#### (2) Computing enclave pilot program ####

#### (A) In general ####

The Director, in consultation with the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Secretary of Energy, and the heads of other relevant Federal departments and agencies, shall establish a pilot program to make awards to ensure the security of federally supported research data and to assist regional institutions of higher education and their researchers in compliance with regulations regarding the safeguarding of sensitive information and other relevant regulations and Federal guidelines.

#### (B) Structure ####

In carrying out the pilot program established pursuant to subparagraph (A), the Director shall select, for the development, installation, maintenance, or sustainment of secure computing enclaves, three institutions of higher education that have an established graduate student program and a demonstrated history of working with secure information, consistent with appropriate security protocols.

#### (C) Regionalization ####

#### (i) In general ####

In selecting universities pursuant to subparagraph (B), the Director shall give preference to institutions of higher education with the capability of serving other regional universities.

#### (ii) Geographic dispersal ####

The enclaves should be geographically dispersed to better meet the needs of regional interests.

#### (D) Program elements ####

The Director shall work with institutions of higher education selected pursuant to subparagraph (B) to—

(i) develop an approved design blueprint for compliance with Federal data protection protocols;

(ii) develop a comprehensive and confidential list, or a bill of materials, of each binary component of the software, firmware, or product that is required to deploy additional secure computing enclaves;

(iii) develop templates for all policies and procedures required to operate the secure computing enclave in a research setting;

(iv) develop a system security plan template; and

(v) develop a process for managing a plan of action and milestones for the secure computing enclave.

#### (E) Sustainability ####

In reviewing applications for awards, the Director shall review and consider plans and prospects of the applicant institution of higher education to ensure long-term sustainability of the computing enclave, beyond the availability of Federal funds.

#### (F) Duration ####

Subject to other availability of appropriations, the pilot program established pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall operate for not less than 3 years.

#### (G) Report ####

#### (i) In general ####

The Director shall report to Congress not later than 6 months after the completion of the pilot program under subparagraph (A).

#### (ii) Contents ####

The report required under clause (i) shall include—

(I) an assessment of the pilot program under subparagraph (A), including an assessment of the security benefits provided by such secure computing enclaves;

(II) recommendations related to the value of expanding the network of secure computing enclaves; and

(III) recommendations on the efficacy of the use of secure computing enclaves by other Federal agencies in a broader effort to expand security of Federal research.

#### (H) Authorization of appropriations ####

There is authorized to be appropriated to the Director, $38,000,000 for fiscal years 2023 through 2025, to carry out the activities outlined in this paragraph.
