#### (a) In general ####

There are authorized to be appropriated from time to time, out of any moneys in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, to the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund—

(1)(A) a Government contribution equal to the aggregate premiums payable for a month for enrollees age 65 and over under this part and deposited in the Trust Fund, multiplied by the ratio of—

(i) twice the dollar amount of the actuarially adequate rate per enrollee age 65 and over as determined under section 1395r(a)(1) of this title for such month minus the dollar amount of the premium per enrollee for such month, as determined under section 1395r(a)(3) of this title, to

(ii) the dollar amount of the premium per enrollee for such month, plus

(B) a Government contribution equal to the aggregate premiums payable for a month for enrollees under age 65 under this part and deposited in the Trust Fund, multiplied by the ratio of—

(i) twice the dollar amount of the actuarially adequate rate per enrollee under age 65 as determined under section 1395r(a)(4) of this title for such month minus the dollar amount of the premium per enrollee for such month, as determined under section 1395r(a)(3) of this title, to

(ii) the dollar amount of the premium per enrollee for such month; minus

(C) the aggregate amount of additional premium payments attributable to the application of section 1395r(i) of this title; plus

(2) such sums as the Secretary deems necessary to place the Trust Fund, at the end of any fiscal year occurring after June 30, 1967, in the same position in which it would have been at the end of such fiscal year if (A) a Government contribution representing the excess of the premiums deposited in the Trust Fund during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1967, over the Government contribution actually appropriated to the Trust Fund during such fiscal year had been appropriated to it on June 30, 1967, and (B) the Government contribution for premiums deposited in the Trust Fund after June 30, 1967, had been appropriated to it when such premiums were deposited; plus

(3) a Government contribution equal to the amount of payment incentives payable under sections 1395w–4(o) and 1395w–23(l)(3) of this title.

In applying paragraph (1), the amounts transferred under subsection (d)(1) with respect to enrollees described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of such subsection shall be treated as premiums payable and deposited in the Trust Fund under subparagraphs (A) and (B), respectively, of paragraph (1).

#### (b) Contingency reserve ####

In order to assure prompt payment of benefits provided under this part and the administrative expenses thereunder during the early months of the program established by this part, and to provide a contingency reserve, there is also authorized to be appropriated, out of any moneys in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, to remain available through the calendar year 1969 for repayable advances (without interest) to the Trust Fund, an amount equal to $18 multiplied by the number of individuals (as estimated by the Secretary) who could be covered in July 1966 by the insurance program established by this part if they had theretofore enrolled under this part.

#### (c) Election under section 1395w–24 ####

The Secretary shall determine the Government contribution under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subsection (a)(1) of this section without regard to any premium reduction resulting from an election under section 1395w–24(f)(1)(E) of this title or any credits provided under section 1395w–24(b)(1)(C)(iv) <sup><a href="#1395w_1_target" name="1395w_1">1</a></sup> of this title and without regard to any premium adjustment effected under sections 1395r(h) and 1395w–29(f) <sup><a href="#1395w_1_target" name="1395w_1">1</a></sup> of this title and without regard to any premium adjustment under section 1395r(i) of this title.

#### (d) Transfer of certain General Fund amounts for 2016 ####

(1) For 2016, there shall be transferred from the General Fund to the Trust Fund an amount, as estimated by the Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, equal to the reduction in aggregate premiums payable under this part for a month in such year (excluding any changes in amounts collected under section 1395r(i) of this title) that is attributable to the application of section 1395r(a)(5)(A) of this title with respect to—

(A) enrollees age 65 and over; and

(B) enrollees under age 65.

Such amounts shall be transferred from time to time as appropriate.

(2) Premium increases affected under section 1395r(a)(6) of this title shall not be taken into account in applying subsection (a).

(3) There shall be transferred from the Trust Fund to the General Fund of the Treasury amounts equivalent to the additional premiums payable as a result of the application of section 1395r(a)(6) of this title, excluding the aggregate payments attributable to the application of section 1395r(i)(3)(A)(ii)(II) of this title.
