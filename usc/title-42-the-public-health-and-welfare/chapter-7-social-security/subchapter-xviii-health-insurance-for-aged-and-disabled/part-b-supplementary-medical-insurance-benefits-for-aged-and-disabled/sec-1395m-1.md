#### (5) Treatment of discounts ####

The payment rate reported by a laboratory under this subsection shall reflect all discounts, rebates, coupons, and other price concessions, including those described in section 1395w–3a(c)(3) of this title.

#### (6) Ensuring complete reporting ####

In the case where an applicable laboratory has more than one payment rate for the same payor for the same test or more than one payment rate for different payors for the same test, the applicable laboratory shall report each such payment rate and the volume for the test at each such rate under this subsection. Beginning with January 1, 2019, the Secretary may establish rules to aggregate reporting with respect to the situations described in the preceding sentence.

#### (2) Calculation of weighted median ####

For each laboratory test with respect to which information is reported under subsection (a) for a data collection period, the Secretary shall calculate a weighted median for the test for the period, by arraying the distribution of all payment rates reported for the period for each test weighted by volume for each payor and each laboratory.

#### (3) Phase-in of reductions from private payor rate implementation ####

#### (A) In general ####

Payment amounts determined under this subsection for a clinical diagnostic laboratory test for each of 2017 through 2028 shall not result in a reduction in payments for a clinical diagnostic laboratory test for the year of greater than the applicable percent (as defined in subparagraph (B)) of the amount of payment for the test for the preceding year.

#### (5) Sample collection fee ####

In the case of a sample collected from an individual in a skilled nursing facility or by a laboratory on behalf of a home health agency, the nominal fee that would otherwise apply under section 1395l(h)(3)(A) of this title shall be increased by $2.

#### (c) Payment for new tests that are not advanced diagnostic laboratory tests ####

#### (1) Payment during initial period ####

In the case of a clinical diagnostic laboratory test that is assigned a new or substantially revised HCPCS code on or after April 1, 2014, and which is not an advanced diagnostic laboratory test (as defined in subsection (d)(5)), during an initial period until payment rates under subsection (b) are established for the test, payment for the test shall be determined—

(A) using cross-walking (as described in section 414.508(a) of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor regulation) to the most appropriate existing test under the fee schedule under this section during that period; or

(B) if no existing test is comparable to the new test, according to the gapfilling process described in paragraph (2).

#### (4) Explanation of payment rates ####

In the case of a clinical diagnostic laboratory test for which payment is made under this subsection, the Secretary shall make available to the public an explanation of the payment rate for the test, including an explanation of how the criteria described in paragraph (2) and paragraph (3) are applied.

#### (d) Payment for new advanced diagnostic laboratory tests ####

#### (1) Payment during initial period ####

#### (A) In general ####

In the case of an advanced diagnostic laboratory test for which payment has not been made under the fee schedule under section 1395l(h) of this title prior to April 1, 2014, during an initial period of three quarters, the payment amount for the test for such period shall be based on the actual list charge for the laboratory test.

#### (B) Actual list charge ####

For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term "actual list charge", with respect to a laboratory test furnished during such period, means the publicly available rate on the first day at which the test is available for purchase by a private payor.

#### (3) Application of market rates after initial period ####

Subject to paragraph (4), data reported under paragraph (2) shall be used to establish the payment amount for an advanced diagnostic laboratory test after the initial period under paragraph (1)(A) using the methodology described in subsection (b). Such payment amount shall continue to apply until the year following the next data collection period.

#### (4) Recoupment if actual list charge exceeds market rate ####

With respect to the initial period described in paragraph (1)(A), if, after such period, the Secretary determines that the payment amount for an advanced diagnostic laboratory test under paragraph (1)(A) that was applicable during the period was greater than 130 percent of the payment amount for the test established using the methodology described in subsection (b) that is applicable after such period, the Secretary shall recoup the difference between such payment amounts for tests furnished during such period.
