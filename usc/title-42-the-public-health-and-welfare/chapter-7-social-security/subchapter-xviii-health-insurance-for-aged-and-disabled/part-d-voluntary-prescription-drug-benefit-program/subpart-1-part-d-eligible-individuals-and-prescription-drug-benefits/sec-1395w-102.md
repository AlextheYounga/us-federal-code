(II) for alerting the PDP sponsors and MA organizations that offer the prescription drug plans and MA–PD plans in which such individuals are enrolled about such reimbursement arrangements.

#### (ii) Authority to request information from enrollees ####

A PDP sponsor or an MA organization may periodically ask part D eligible individuals enrolled in a prescription drug plan or an MA–PD plan offered by the sponsor or organization whether such individuals have or expect to receive such third-party reimbursement. A material misrepresentation of the information described in the preceding sentence by an individual (as defined in standards set by the Secretary and determined through a process established by the Secretary) shall constitute grounds for termination of enrollment in any plan under section 1395w–21(g)(3)(B) of this title (and as applied under this part under section 1395w–101(b)(1)(B)(v) of this title) for a period specified by the Secretary.

Nothing in this part shall be construed as preventing a PDP sponsor or an MA organization offering an MA–PD plan from reducing to zero the cost-sharing otherwise applicable to preferred or generic drugs.

#### (6) Annual percentage increase ####

The annual percentage increase specified in this paragraph for a year is equal to the annual percentage increase in average per capita aggregate expenditures for covered part D drugs in the United States for part D eligible individuals, as determined by the Secretary for the 12-month period ending in July of the previous year using such methods as the Secretary shall specify.

#### (7) Additional annual percentage increase ####

The annual percentage increase specified in this paragraph for a year is equal to the annual percentage increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers (United States city average) for the 12-month period ending in July of the previous year.

#### (c) Alternative prescription drug coverage requirements ####

A prescription drug plan or an MA–PD plan may provide a different prescription drug benefit design from standard prescription drug coverage so long as the Secretary determines (consistent with section 1395w–111(c) of this title) that the following requirements are met and the plan applies for, and receives, the approval of the Secretary for such benefit design:

#### (1) Assuring at least actuarially equivalent coverage ####

#### (A) Assuring equivalent value of total coverage ####

The actuarial value of the total coverage is at least equal to the actuarial value of standard prescription drug coverage.

#### (B) Assuring equivalent unsubsidized value of coverage ####

The unsubsidized value of the coverage is at least equal to the unsubsidized value of standard prescription drug coverage. For purposes of this subparagraph, the unsubsidized value of coverage is the amount by which the actuarial value of the coverage exceeds the actuarial value of the subsidy payments under section 1395w–115 of this title with respect to such coverage.

#### (C) Assuring standard payment for costs at initial coverage limit ####

The coverage is designed, based upon an actuarially representative pattern of utilization, to provide for the payment, with respect to costs incurred that are equal to the initial coverage limit under subsection (b)(3) for the year, of an amount equal to at least the product of—

(i) the amount by which the initial coverage limit described in subsection (b)(3) for the year exceeds the deductible described in subsection (b)(1) for the year; and

(ii) 100 percent minus the coinsurance percentage specified in subsection (b)(2)(A)(i).

#### (2) Maximum required deductible ####

The deductible under the coverage shall not exceed the deductible amount specified under subsection (b)(1) for the year.

#### (3) Same protection against high out-of-pocket expenditures ####

The coverage provides the coverage required under subsection (b)(4).

#### (d) Access to negotiated prices ####

#### (1) Access ####

#### (A) In general ####

Under qualified prescription drug coverage offered by a PDP sponsor offering a prescription drug plan or an MA organization offering an MA–PD plan, the sponsor or organization shall provide enrollees with access to negotiated prices used for payment for covered part D drugs, regardless of the fact that no benefits may be payable under the coverage with respect to such drugs because of the application of a deductible or other cost-sharing or an initial coverage limit (described in subsection (b)(3)).

#### (B) Negotiated prices ####

For purposes of this part, negotiated prices shall take into account negotiated price concessions, such as discounts, direct or indirect subsidies, rebates, and direct or indirect remunerations, for covered part D drugs, and include any dispensing fees for such drugs.

#### (C) Medicaid-related provisions ####

The prices negotiated by a prescription drug plan, by an MA–PD plan with respect to covered part D drugs, or by a qualified retiree prescription drug plan (as defined in section 1395w–132(a)(2) of this title) with respect to such drugs on behalf of part D eligible individuals, shall (notwithstanding any other provision of law) not be taken into account for the purposes of establishing the best price under section 1396r–8(c)(1)(C) of this title.

#### (2) Disclosure ####

A PDP sponsor offering a prescription drug plan or an MA organization offering an MA–PD plan shall disclose to the Secretary (in a manner specified by the Secretary) the aggregate negotiated price concessions described in paragraph (1)(B) made available to the sponsor or organization by a manufacturer which are passed through in the form of lower subsidies, lower monthly beneficiary prescription drug premiums, and lower prices through pharmacies and other dispensers. The provisions of section 1396r–8(b)(3)(D) of this title apply to information disclosed to the Secretary under this paragraph.

#### (3) Audits ####

To protect against fraud and abuse and to ensure proper disclosures and accounting under this part and in accordance with section 1395w–27(d)(2)(B) of this title (as applied under section 1395w–112(b)(3)(C) of this title), the Secretary may conduct periodic audits, directly or through contracts, of the financial statements and records of PDP sponsors with respect to prescription drug plans and MA organizations with respect to MA–PD plans.
