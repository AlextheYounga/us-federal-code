### §677. John H. Chafee Foster Care Program for Successful Transition to Adulthood ###

#### (a) Purpose ####

The purpose of this section is to provide States with flexible funding that will enable programs to be designed and conducted—

(1) to support all youth who have experienced foster care at age 14 or older in their transition to adulthood through transitional services such as assistance in obtaining a high school diploma and post-secondary education, career exploration, vocational training, job placement and retention, training and opportunities to practice daily living skills (such as financial literacy training and driving instruction), substance abuse prevention, and preventive health activities (including smoking avoidance, nutrition education, and pregnancy prevention);

(2) to help children who have experienced foster care at age 14 or older achieve meaningful, permanent connections with a caring adult;

(3) to help children who have experienced foster care at age 14 or older engage in age or developmentally appropriate activities, positive youth development, and experiential learning that reflects what their peers in intact families experience;

(4) to provide financial, housing, counseling, employment, education, and other appropriate support and services to former foster care recipients between 18 and 21 years of age (or 23 years of age, in the case of a State with a certification under subsection (b)(3)(A)(ii) to provide assistance and services to youths who have aged out of foster care and have not attained such age, in accordance with such subsection) to complement their own efforts to achieve self-sufficiency and to assure that program participants recognize and accept their personal responsibility for preparing for and then making the transition from adolescence to adulthood;

(5) to make available vouchers for education and training, including postsecondary training and education, to youths who have aged out of foster care;

(6) to provide the services referred to in this subsection to children who, after attaining 16 years of age, have left foster care for kinship guardianship or adoption; and

(7) to ensure children who are likely to remain in foster care until 18 years of age have regular, ongoing opportunities to engage in age or developmentally-appropriate activities as defined in section 675(11) of this title.

#### Findings ####

Pub. L. 106–169, title I, §101(a), Dec. 14, 1999, 113 Stat. 1823, provided that: "The Congress finds the following:

"(1) States are required to make reasonable efforts to find adoptive families for all children, including older children, for whom reunification with their biological family is not in the best interests of the child. However, some older children will continue to live in foster care. These children should be enrolled in an Independent Living program designed and conducted by State and local government to help prepare them for employment, postsecondary education, and successful management of adult responsibilities.

"(2) Older children who continue to be in foster care as adolescents may become eligible for Independent Living programs. These Independent Living programs are not an alternative to adoption for these children. Enrollment in Independent Living programs can occur concurrent with continued efforts to locate and achieve placement in adoptive families for older children in foster care.

"(3) About 20,000 adolescents leave the Nation's foster care system each year because they have reached 18 years of age and are expected to support themselves.

"(4) Congress has received extensive information that adolescents leaving foster care have significant difficulty making a successful transition to adulthood; this information shows that children aging out of foster care show high rates of homelessness, non-marital childbearing, poverty, and delinquent or criminal behavior; they are also frequently the target of crime and physical assaults.

"(5) The Nation's State and local governments, with financial support from the Federal Government, should offer an extensive program of education, training, employment, and financial support for young adults leaving foster care, with participation in such program beginning several years before high school graduation and continuing, as needed, until the young adults emancipated from foster care establish independence or reach 21 years of age."

#### Study and Report Evaluating Effectiveness of Programs ####

Pub. L. 101–239, title VIII, §8002(d), Dec. 19, 1989, 103 Stat. 2453, provided that:

"(1) Study.—The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall study the programs authorized under section 477 of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 677] for the purposes of evaluating the effectiveness of the programs. The study shall include a comparison of outcomes of children who participated in the programs and a comparable group of children who did not participate in the programs.

"(2) Report.—Upon completion of the study, the Secretary shall issue a report to the Committee on Finance of the Senate and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives."
