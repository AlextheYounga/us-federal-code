If a State provides child health assistance or health benefits coverage to parents of a targeted low-income child in accordance with section 1397kk(b) of this title, the State may elect to offer a premium assistance subsidy to a parent of a targeted low-income child who is eligible for such a subsidy under this paragraph in the same manner as the State offers such a subsidy for the enrollment of the child in qualified employer-sponsored coverage, except that—

(i) the amount of the premium assistance subsidy shall be increased to take into account the cost of the enrollment of the parent in the qualified employer-sponsored coverage or, at the option of the State if the State determines it cost-effective, the cost of the enrollment of the child's family in such coverage; and

(ii) any reference in this paragraph to a child is deemed to include a reference to the parent or, if applicable under clause (i), the family of the child.

#### (I) Additional State option for providing premium assistance ####

#### (i) In general ####

A State may establish an employer-family premium assistance purchasing pool for employers with less than 250 employees who have at least 1 employee who is a pregnant woman eligible for assistance under the State child health plan (including through the application of an option described in section 1397ll(f) of this title) or a member of a family with at least 1 targeted low-income child and to provide a premium assistance subsidy under this paragraph for enrollment in coverage made available through such pool.

#### (ii) Access to choice of coverage ####

A State that elects the option under clause (i) shall identify and offer access to not less than 2 private health plans that are health benefits coverage that is equivalent to the benefits coverage in a benchmark benefit package described in section 1397cc(b) of this title or benchmark-equivalent coverage that meets the requirements of section 1397cc(a)(2) of this title for employees described in clause (i).

#### (iii) Clarification of payment for administrative expenditures ####

Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed as permitting payment under this section for administrative expenditures attributable to the establishment or operation of such pool, except to the extent that such payment would otherwise be permitted under this subchapter.

#### (J) No effect on premium assistance waiver programs ####

Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as limiting the authority of a State to offer premium assistance under section 1396e or 1396e–1 of this title, a waiver described in paragraph (2)(B) or (3), a waiver approved under section 1315 of this title, or other authority in effect prior to February 4, 2009.

#### (K) Notice of availability ####

If a State elects to provide premium assistance subsidies in accordance with this paragraph, the State shall—

(i) include on any application or enrollment form for child health assistance a notice of the availability of premium assistance subsidies for the enrollment of targeted low-income children in qualified employer-sponsored coverage;

(ii) provide, as part of the application and enrollment process under the State child health plan, information describing the availability of such subsidies and how to elect to obtain such a subsidy; and

(iii) establish such other procedures as the State determines necessary to ensure that parents are fully informed of the choices for receiving child health assistance under the State child health plan or through the receipt of premium assistance subsidies.

#### (L) Application to qualified employer-sponsored benchmark coverage ####

If a group health plan or health insurance coverage offered through an employer is certified by an actuary as health benefits coverage that is equivalent to the benefits coverage in a benchmark benefit package described in section 1397cc(b) of this title or benchmark-equivalent coverage that meets the requirements of section 1397cc(a)(2) of this title, the State may provide premium assistance subsidies for enrollment of targeted low-income children in such group health plan or health insurance coverage in the same manner as such subsidies are provided under this paragraph for enrollment in qualified employer-sponsored coverage, but without regard to the requirement to provide supplemental coverage for benefits and cost-sharing protection provided under the State child health plan under subparagraph (E).

#### (M) Coordination with medicaid ####

In the case of a targeted low-income child who receives child health assistance through a State plan under subchapter XIX and who voluntarily elects to receive a premium assistance subsidy under this section, the provisions of section 1396e–1 of this title shall apply and shall supersede any other provisions of this paragraph that are inconsistent with such section.

#### (d) Maintenance of effort ####

#### (1) In medicaid eligibility standards ####

No payment may be made under subsection (a) with respect to child health assistance provided under a State child health plan if the State adopts income and resource standards and methodologies for purposes of determining a child's eligibility for medical assistance under the State plan under subchapter XIX that are more restrictive than those applied as of June 1, 1997, except as required under section 1396a(e)(14) of this title.

#### (2) In amounts of payment expended for certain State-funded health insurance programs for children ####

#### (A) In general ####

The amount of the allotment for a State in a fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 1999) shall be reduced by the amount by which—

(i) the total of the State children's health insurance expenditures in the preceding fiscal year, is less than

(ii) the total of such expenditures in fiscal year 1996.

#### (B) State children's health insurance expenditures ####

The term "State children's health insurance expenditures" means the following:

During the period that begins on March 23, 2010, and ends on September 30, 2029, as a condition of receiving payments under section 1396b(a) of this title, a State shall not have in effect eligibility standards, methodologies, or procedures under its State child health plan (including any waiver under such plan) for children (including children provided medical assistance for which payment is made under section 1397ee(a)(1)(A) of this title) that are more restrictive than the eligibility standards, methodologies, or procedures, respectively, under such plan (or waiver) as in effect on March 23, 2010. During the period that begins on October 1, 2019, and ends on September 30, 2029, the preceding sentence shall only apply with respect to children in families whose income does not exceed 300 percent of the poverty line (as defined in section 1397jj(c)(5) of this title) applicable to a family of the size involved. The preceding sentences shall not be construed as preventing a State during any such periods from—

(i) applying eligibility standards, methodologies, or procedures for children under the State child health plan or under any waiver of the plan that are less restrictive than the eligibility standards, methodologies, or procedures, respectively, for children under the plan or waiver that are in effect on March 23, 2010;

(ii) after September 30, 2015, enrolling children eligible to be targeted low-income children under the State child health plan in a qualified health plan that has been certified by the Secretary under subparagraph (C); or

(iii) imposing a limitation described in section 1397ll(b)(7) of this title for a fiscal year in order to limit expenditures under the State child health plan to those for which Federal financial participation is available under this section for the fiscal year.

#### (B) Assurance of exchange coverage for targeted low-income children unable to be provided child health assistance as a result of funding shortfalls ####

In the event that allotments provided under section 1397dd of this title are insufficient to provide coverage to all children who are eligible to be targeted low-income children under the State child health plan under this subchapter, a State shall establish procedures to ensure that such children are screened for eligibility for medical assistance under the State plan under subchapter XIX or a waiver of that plan and, if found eligible, enrolled in such plan or a waiver. In the case of such children who, as a result of such screening, are determined to not be eligible for medical assistance under the State plan or a waiver under subchapter XIX, the State shall establish procedures to ensure that the children are enrolled in a qualified health plan that has been certified by the Secretary under subparagraph (C) and is offered through an Exchange established by the State under section 18031 of this title. For purposes of eligibility for premium assistance for the purchase of a qualified health plan under section 36B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and reduced cost-sharing under section 18071 of this title, children described in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to be ineligible for coverage under the State child health plan.

#### (C) Certification of comparability of pediatric coverage offered by qualified health plans ####

With respect to each State, the Secretary, not later than April 1, 2015, shall review the benefits offered for children and the cost-sharing imposed with respect to such benefits by qualified health plans offered through an Exchange established by the State under section 18031 of this title and shall certify those plans that offer benefits for children and impose cost-sharing with respect to such benefits that the Secretary determines are at least comparable to the benefits offered and cost-sharing protections provided under the State child health plan.

#### (e) Advance payment; retrospective adjustment ####

The Secretary may make payments under this section for each quarter on the basis of advance estimates of expenditures submitted by the State and such other investigation as the Secretary may find necessary, and may reduce or increase the payments as necessary to adjust for any overpayment or underpayment for prior quarters.

#### (f) Flexibility in submittal of claims ####

Nothing in this section or subsections (e) and (f) of section 1397dd of this title shall be construed as preventing a State from claiming as expenditures in the quarter expenditures that were incurred in a previous quarter.

#### (g) Authority for qualifying States to use certain funds for medicaid expenditures ####

#### (1) State option ####

#### (A) In general ####

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, subject to paragraph (4), a qualifying State (as defined in paragraph (2)) may elect to use not more than 20 percent of any allotment under section 1397dd of this title for fiscal year 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, or 2008 (insofar as it is available under subsections (e) and (g) of such section) for payments under subchapter XIX in accordance with subparagraph (B), instead of for expenditures under this subchapter.

#### (iii) No impact on determination of budget neutrality for waivers ####

In the case of a qualifying State that uses amounts paid under this subsection for expenditures described in clause (ii) that are incurred under a waiver approved for the State, any budget neutrality determinations with respect to such waiver shall be determined without regard to such amounts paid.

#### (2) Qualifying State ####

In this subsection, the term "qualifying State" means a State that, on and after April 15, 1997, has an income eligibility standard that is at least 184 percent of the poverty line with respect to any 1 or more categories of children (other than infants) who are eligible for medical assistance under section 1396a(a)(10)(A) of this title or, in the case of a State that has a statewide waiver in effect under section 1315 of this title with respect to subchapter XIX that was first implemented on August 1, 1994, or July 1, 1995, has an income eligibility standard under such waiver for children that is at least 185 percent of the poverty line, or, in the case of a State that has a statewide waiver in effect under section 1315 of this title with respect to subchapter XIX that was first implemented on January 1, 1994, has an income eligibility standard under such waiver for children who lack health insurance that is at least 185 percent of the poverty line, or, in the case of a State that had a statewide waiver in effect under section 1315 of this title with respect to subchapter XIX that was first implemented on October 1, 1993, had an income eligibility standard under such waiver for children that was at least 185 percent of the poverty line and on and after July 1, 1998, has an income eligibility standard for children under section 1396a(a)(10)(A) of this title or a statewide waiver in effect under section 1315 of this title with respect to subchapter XIX that is at least 185 percent of the poverty line.

"(b) Final Rule Required To Be in Effect for All States.—Notwithstanding parts 431 and 457 of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on the date of enactment of this Act [Feb. 4, 2009]), the Secretary shall not calculate or publish any national or State-specific error rate based on the application of the payment error rate measurement (in this section referred to as 'PERM') requirements to CHIP until after the date that is 6 months after the date on which a new final rule (in this section referred to as the 'new final rule') promulgated after the date of the enactment of this Act [Feb. 4, 2009] and implementing such requirements in accordance with the requirements of subsection (c) is in effect for all States. Any calculation of a national error rate or a State specific error rate after such new final rule in effect for all States may only be inclusive of errors, as defined in such new final rule or in guidance issued within a reasonable time frame after the effective date for such new final rule that includes detailed guidance for the specific methodology for error determinations. The Secretary is not required under this subsection to calculate or publish a national or a State-specific error rate for fiscal year 2009 or fiscal year 2010.

"(c) Requirements for New Final Rule.—For purposes of subsection (b), the requirements of this subsection are that the new final rule implementing the PERM requirements shall—

"(1) include—

"(A) clearly defined criteria for errors for both States and providers;

"(B) a clearly defined process for appealing error determinations by—

"(i) review contractors; or

"(ii) the agency and personnel described in section 431.974(a)(2) of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on September 1, 2007, responsible for the development, direction, implementation, and evaluation of eligibility reviews and associated activities; and

"(C) clearly defined responsibilities and deadlines for States in implementing any corrective action plans; and

"(2) provide that the payment error rate determined for a State shall not take into account payment errors resulting from the State's verification of an applicant's self-declaration or self-certification of eligibility for, and the correct amount of, medical assistance or child health assistance, if the State process for verifying an applicant's self-declaration or self-certification satisfies the requirements for such process applicable under regulations promulgated by the Secretary or otherwise approved by the Secretary.

"(d) Option for Application of Data for States in First Application Cycle Under the Interim Final Rule.—After the new final rule implementing the PERM requirements in accordance with the requirements of subsection (c) is in effect for all States, a State for which the PERM requirements were first in effect under an interim final rule for fiscal year 2007 or under a final rule for fiscal year 2008 may elect to accept any payment error rate determined in whole or in part for the State on the basis of data for that fiscal year or may elect to not have any payment error rate determined on the basis of such data and, instead, shall be treated as if fiscal year 2010 or fiscal year 2011 were the first fiscal year for which the PERM requirements apply to the State.

"(e) Harmonization of MEQC and PERM.—

"(1) Reduction of redundancies.—The Secretary shall review the Medicaid Eligibility Quality Control (in this subsection referred to as the 'MEQC') requirements with the PERM requirements and coordinate consistent implementation of both sets of requirements, while reducing redundancies.

"(2) State option to apply perm data.—A State may elect, for purposes of determining the erroneous excess payments for medical assistance ratio applicable to the State for a fiscal year under section 1903(u) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396b(u)) to substitute data resulting from the application of the PERM requirements to the State after the new final rule implementing such requirements is in effect for all States for data obtained from the application of the MEQC requirements to the State with respect to a fiscal year.

"(3) State option to apply meqc data.—For purposes of satisfying the requirements of subpart Q of part 431 of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations, relating to Medicaid eligibility reviews, a State may elect to substitute data obtained through MEQC reviews conducted in accordance with section 1903(u) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396b(u)) for data required for purposes of PERM requirements, but only if the State MEQC reviews are based on a broad, representative sample of Medicaid applicants or enrollees in the States.

"(f) Identification of Improved State-Specific Sample Sizes.—The Secretary shall establish State-specific sample sizes for application of the PERM requirements with respect to State child health plans for fiscal years beginning with the first fiscal year that begins on or after the date on which the new final rule is in effect for all States, on the basis of such information as the Secretary determines appropriate. In establishing such sample sizes, the Secretary shall, to the greatest extent practicable—

"(1) minimize the administrative cost burden on States under Medicaid and CHIP; and

"(2) maintain State flexibility to manage such programs.

"(g) Time for Promulgation of Final Rule.—The final rule implementing the PERM requirements under subsection (b) shall be promulgated not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of this Act [Feb. 4, 2009]."
