Such standards may not discriminate on the basis of diagnosis.

(C) that the insurance provided under the State child health plan does not substitute for coverage under group health plans;

(D) the provision of child health assistance to targeted low-income children in the State who are Indians (as defined in section 1603(c) <sup><a href="#1397bb_1_target" name="1397bb_1">1</a></sup> of title 25); and

#### (B) Deemed compliance if joint application and renewal process that permits application other than in person ####

A State shall be deemed to comply with subparagraph (A) if the State's application and renewal forms and supplemental forms (if any) and information verification process is the same for purposes of establishing and renewing eligibility for children and pregnant women for medical assistance under subchapter XIX and child health assistance under this subchapter, and such process does not require an application to be made in person or a face-to-face interview.

#### (c) Outreach and coordination ####

A State child health plan shall include a description of the procedures to be used by the State to accomplish the following:

#### (1) Outreach ####

Outreach (through community health workers and others) to families of children likely to be eligible for child health assistance under the plan or under other public or private health coverage programs to inform these families of the availability of, and to assist them in enrolling their children in, such a program.

#### (2) Coordination with other health insurance programs ####

Coordination of the administration of the State program under this subchapter with other public and private health insurance programs.

#### (1) In general ####

The State child health plan shall provide that—

(A) the State shall not terminate eligibility for child health or pregnancy-related assistance under the State child health plan for a targeted low-income child or targeted low-income pregnant woman because the child or pregnant woman is an inmate of a public institution, but may suspend coverage during the period the child or pregnant woman is such an inmate;

(B) in the case of a targeted low-income child who was determined eligible for child health assistance under the State child health plan (or waiver of such plan) immediately before becoming an inmate of a public institution, the State shall, prior to the child's release from such public institution, conduct a redetermination of eligibility for such child with respect to such child health assistance (without requiring a new application from the child) and, if the State determines pursuant to such redetermination that the child continues to meet the eligibility requirements for such child health assistance, the State shall restore coverage for such child health assistance to such child upon the child's release from such public institution; and

(C) in the case of a targeted low-income child who is determined eligible for child health assistance while an inmate of a public institution (subject to the exception to the exclusion of children who are inmates of a public institution described in section 1397jj(b)(7) of this title), the State shall process any application for child health assistance submitted by, or on behalf of, the child such that the State makes a determination of eligibility for the child with respect to child health assistance upon release of the child from the public institution.

#### (2) Required coverage of screenings, diagnostic services, referrals, and case management for certain inmates pre-release ####

A State child health plan shall provide that, in the case of a targeted low-income child who is within 30 days of the date on which such child is scheduled to be released from a public institution following adjudication, the State shall have in place a plan for providing, and shall provide in accordance with such plan, screenings, diagnostic services, referrals, and case management services otherwise covered under the State child health plan (or waiver of such plan) in the same manner as described in section 1396a(a)(84)(D) of this title.
