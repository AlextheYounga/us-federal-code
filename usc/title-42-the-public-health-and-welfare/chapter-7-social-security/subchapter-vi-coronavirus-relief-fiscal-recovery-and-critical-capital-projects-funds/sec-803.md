#### (ii) Distribution of funds ####

#### (I) Extension for distribution ####

If an authorized officer of a State required to make distributions under clause (i) certifies in writing to the Secretary before the end of the 30-day distribution period described in such clause that it would constitute an excessive administrative burden for the State to meet the terms of such clause with respect to 1 or more such distributions, the authorized officer may request, and the Secretary shall grant, an extension of such period of not more than 30 days to allow the State to make such distributions in accordance with clause (i).

#### (II) Additional extensions ####

#### (aa) In general ####

If a State has been granted an extension to the distribution period under subclause (I) but is unable to make all the distributions required under clause (i) before the end of such period as extended, an authorized officer of the State may request an additional extension of the distribution period of not more than 30 days. The Secretary may grant a request for an additional extension of such period only if—

(AA) the authorized officer making such request provides a written plan to the Secretary specifying, for each distribution for which an additional extension is requested, when the State expects to make such distribution and the actions the State has taken and will take in order to make all such distributions before the end of the distribution period (as extended under subclause (I) and this subclause); and

(BB) the Secretary determines that such plan is reasonably designed to distribute all such funds to nonentitlement units of local government by the end of the distribution period (as so extended).
