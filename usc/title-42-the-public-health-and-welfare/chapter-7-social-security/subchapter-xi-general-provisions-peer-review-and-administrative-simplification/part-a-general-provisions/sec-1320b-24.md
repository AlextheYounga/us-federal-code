#### **Editorial Notes** ####

#### Codification ####

Section was enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and not as part of the Social Security Act which comprises this chapter.

#### Amendments ####

**2022**—Pub. L. 117–286 substituted "chapter 10 of title 5" for "the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.)".

[<sup>1</sup> So in original. Probably should be "Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services".](#1320b-24_1)
