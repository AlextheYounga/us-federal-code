#### “SEC. 701. SHORT TITLE. ####

“This title may be cited as the ‘National Oilheat Research Alliance Act of 2000’.

#### “SEC. 702. FINDINGS. ####

“Congress finds that—

“(1) oilheat fuel is an important commodity relied on by approximately 30,000,000 Americans as an efficient and economical energy source for commercial and residential space and hot water heating;

“(2) oilheat fuel equipment operates at efficiencies among the highest of any space heating energy source, reducing fuel costs and making oilheat fuel an economical means of space heating;

“(3) the production, distribution, and marketing of oilheat fuel and oilheat fuel equipment plays a significant role in the economy of the United States, accounting for approximately $12,900,000,000 in expenditures annually and employing millions of Americans in all aspects of the oilheat fuel industry;

“(4) only very limited Federal resources have been made available for oilheat fuel research, development, safety, training, and education efforts, to the detriment of both the oilheat fuel industry and its 30,000,000 consumers;

“(5) the cooperative development, self-financing, and implementation of a coordinated national oilheat fuel industry program of research and development, training, and consumer education is necessary and important for the welfare of the oilheat fuel industry, the general economy of the United States, and the millions of Americans that rely on oilheat fuel for commercial and residential space and hot water heating;

“(6) consumers of oilheat fuel fuel [sic] are provided service by thousands of small businesses that are unable to individually develop training programs to facilitate the entry of new and qualified workers into the oilheat fuel fuel [sic] industry;

“(7) small businesses and trained employees are in an ideal position—

“(A) to provide information to consumers about the benefits of improved efficiency; and

“(B) to encourage consumers to value efficiency in energy choices and assist individuals in conserving energy;

“(8) additional research is necessary—

“(A) to improve oilheat fuel fuel [sic] equipment; and

“(B) to develop domestic renewable resources that can be used to safely and affordably heat homes;

“(9) since there are no Federal resources available to assist the oilheat fuel fuel [sic] industry, it is necessary and appropriate to develop a self-funded program dedicated—

“(A) to improving efficiency in customer homes;

“(B) to assist individuals to gain employment in the oilheat fuel fuel [sic] industry; and

“(C) to develop domestic renewable resources;

“(10) both consumers of oilheat fuel fuel [sic] and retailers would benefit from the self-funded program; and

“(11) the oilheat fuel fuel [sic] industry is committed to providing appropriate funding necessary to carry out the purposes of this title without passing additional costs on to residential consumers.

(b) The Secretary shall establish requirements and procedures, which shall be observed by each agency unless a waiver is granted by the Secretary, designed to ensure that each agency to the maximum extent practicable aims to achieve the following goals:

(1) For the total of all Federally-owned existing buildings the goal shall be a reduction of 20 percent in the average annual energy use per gross square foot of floor area in 1985 from the average energy use per gross square foot of floor area in 1975. This goal shall apply to all buildings for which construction was or design specifications were completed prior to the date of promulgation of the guidelines pursuant to subsection (d) of this Section.

(2) For the total of all Federally-owned new buildings the goal shall be a reduction of 45 percent in the average annual energy requirement per gross square foot of floor area in 1985 from the average annual energy use per gross square foot of floor area in 1975. This goal shall apply to all new buildings for which design specifications are completed after the date of promulgation of the guidelines pursuant to subsection (d) of this Section.

(c) The Secretary with the concurrence of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in consultation with the heads of the Executive agencies specified in subsection (a) and the Director of the National Bureau of Standards, shall establish, for purposes of developing the ten-year plan, a practical and effective method for estimating and comparing life cycle capital and operating costs for Federal buildings, including residential, commercial, and industrial type categories. Such method shall be consistent with the Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A–94, and shall be adopted and used by all agencies in developing their plans pursuant to subsection (e), annual reports pursuant to subsection (g), and budget estimates pursuant to subsection (h). For purposes of this paragraph, the term “life cycle cost” means the total costs of owning, operating, and maintaining a building over its economic life, including its fuel and energy costs, determined on the basis of a systematic evaluation and comparison of alternative building systems.

(e)(1) The head of each Executive agency that maintains any existing building or will maintain any new building shall submit no later than six months after the issuance of guidelines pursuant to subsection (d), to the Secretary a ten-year plan designed to the maximum extent practicable to meet the goals in subsection (b) for the total of existing or new Federal buildings. Such ten-year plans shall only consider improvements that are cost-effective consistent with the criteria established by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Circular A–94) and the method established pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section. The plan submitted shall specify appropriate energy-saving initiatives and shall estimate the expected improvements by fiscal year in terms of specific accomplishments—energy savings and cost savings—together with the estimated costs of achieving the savings.

(2) The plans submitted shall, to the maximum extent practicable, include the results of preliminary energy audits of all existing buildings with over 30,000 gross square feet of space owned and maintained by Executive agencies. Further, the second annual report submitted under subsection (g)(2) of this Section shall, to the maximum extent practicable, include the results of preliminary energy audits of all existing buildings with more than 5,000 but not more than 30,000 gross square feet of space. The purpose of such preliminary energy audits shall be to identify the type, size, energy use level and major energy using systems of existing Federal buildings.

(3) The Secretary shall evaluate agency plans relative to the guidelines established pursuant to subsection (d) for such plans and relative to the cost estimating method established pursuant to subsection (c).
