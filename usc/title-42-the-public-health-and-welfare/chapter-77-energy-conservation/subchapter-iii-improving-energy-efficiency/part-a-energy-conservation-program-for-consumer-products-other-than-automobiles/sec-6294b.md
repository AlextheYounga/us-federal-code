### §6294b. WaterSense program ###

#### (a) Establishment of WaterSense program ####

#### (1) In general ####

There is established within the Environmental Protection Agency a voluntary program, to be known as the WaterSense program, to identify and promote water-efficient products, buildings, landscapes, facilities, processes, and services in order to, through voluntary labeling of, or other forms of communications regarding, such products, buildings, landscapes, facilities, processes, and services while meeting strict performance criteria, sensibly—

(A) reduce water use;

(B) reduce the strain on public water systems, community water systems, and wastewater and stormwater infrastructure;

(C) conserve energy used to pump, heat, transport, and treat water; and

(D) preserve water resources for future generations.

#### (2) Inclusions ####

Categories of products, buildings, landscapes, facilities, processes, and services that may be included under the program include—

(A) irrigation technologies and services;

(B) point-of-use water treatment devices;

(C) plumbing products;

(D) water reuse and recycling technologies;

(E) landscaping and gardening products, including moisture control or water enhancing technologies;

(F) xeriscaping and other landscape conversions that reduce water use;

(G) whole house humidifiers; and

(H) water-efficient buildings or facilities.

#### (b) Duties ####

The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in coordination with the Secretary of Energy as appropriate, shall—

(1) establish—

(A) a WaterSense label to be used for products, buildings, landscapes, facilities, processes, and services meeting the certification criteria established pursuant to this section; and

(B) the procedure, including the methods and means, and criteria by which products, buildings, landscapes, facilities, processes, and services may be certified to display the WaterSense label;

(2) enhance public awareness regarding the WaterSense label through outreach and public education;

(3) preserve the integrity of the WaterSense label by—

(A) establishing and maintaining feasible performance criteria so that products, buildings, landscapes, facilities, processes, and services certified to display the WaterSense label perform as well or better than less water-efficient counterparts;

(B) overseeing WaterSense certifications made by third parties, which shall be independent third-party product certification bodies accredited by an accreditation entity domiciled in the United States;

(C) using testing protocols, from the appropriate, applicable, and relevant consensus standards, for the purpose of determining compliance with performance criteria; and

(D) auditing the use of the WaterSense label in the marketplace and preventing cases of misuse;

(4) not more frequently than every 6 years after adoption or major revision of any WaterSense performance criteria, review and, if appropriate, revise the performance criteria to achieve additional water savings;

(5) in revising any WaterSense criteria—

(A) provide reasonable notice to interested parties and the public of any changes, including effective dates, and an explanation of the changes;

(B) solicit comments from interested parties and the public prior to any changes;

(C) as appropriate, respond to comments submitted by interested parties and the public; and

(D) provide an appropriate transition time prior to the applicable effective date of any changes, taking into account the timing necessary for the manufacture, marketing, training, and distribution of the specific product, building, landscape, process, or service category being addressed; and

(6) not later than December 31, 2019, consider for review and revise, if necessary, any WaterSense performance criteria adopted before January 1, 2012.

#### (c) Transparency ####

The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall, to the extent practicable and not less than annually, estimate and make available to the public the relative water and energy savings attributable to the use of WaterSense-labeled products, buildings, landscapes, facilities, processes, and services.

#### (d) Distinction of authorities ####

In setting or maintaining specifications and criteria for Energy Star pursuant to section 6294a of this title, and WaterSense under this section, the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall coordinate to prevent duplicative or conflicting requirements among the respective programs.

#### (e) No warranty ####

A WaterSense label shall not create any express or implied warranty.

#### (f) Methods for establishing performance criteria ####

In establishing performance criteria for products, buildings, landscapes, facilities, processes, or services pursuant to this section, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall use technical specifications and testing protocols established by voluntary consensus standards organizations relevant to specific products, buildings, landscapes, facilities, processes, or services, as appropriate.

#### (g) Definition of feasible ####

The term "feasible" means feasible with the use of the best technology, techniques, and other means that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency finds, after examination for efficacy under field conditions and not solely under laboratory conditions, are available (taking cost into consideration).
