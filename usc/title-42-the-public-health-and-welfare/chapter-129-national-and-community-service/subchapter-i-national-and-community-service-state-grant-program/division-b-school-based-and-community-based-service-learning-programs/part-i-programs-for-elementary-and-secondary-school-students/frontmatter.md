#### Codification ####

Part I of subtitle B of title I of the National and Community Service Act of 1990, comprising this part, was originally added to Pub. L. 101–610, title I, subtitle B, by Pub. L. 103–82, title I, §103(a)(2), Sept. 21, 1993, 107 Stat. 825, and amended by Pub. L. 103–382, Oct. 20, 1994, 108 Stat. 3518. Such part is shown herein, however, as having been added by Pub. L. 111–13, title I, §1201, Apr. 21, 2009, 123 Stat. 1467, without reference to such intervening amendments because of the extensive revision of the part's provisions by Pub. L. 111–13.
