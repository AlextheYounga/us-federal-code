(B) 1/3 of such members shall be public members, including a broad cross section of persons affected with muscular dystrophies including parents or legal guardians, affected individuals, researchers, and clinicians.

Members appointed under subparagraph (B) shall serve for a term of 3 years, and may serve for an unlimited number of terms if reappointed.

#### (3) Chair ####

#### (A) In general ####

With respect to muscular dystrophy, the Chair of the Coordinating Committee shall serve as the principal advisor to the Secretary, the Assistant Secretary for Health, and the Director of NIH, and shall provide advice to the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, and to the heads of other relevant agencies. The Coordinating Committee shall select the Chair for a term not to exceed 2 years.

#### (e) Plan for HHS activities ####

#### (1) In general ####

Not later than 1 year after December 18, 2001, the Coordinating Committee shall develop a plan for conducting and supporting research and education on muscular dystrophy through the national research institutes and shall periodically review and revise the plan. The plan shall—

(A) provide for a broad range of research and education activities relating to biomedical, epidemiological, psychosocial, and rehabilitative issues, including studies of the impact of such diseases in rural and underserved communities;

(B) identify priorities among the programs and activities of the National Institutes of Health regarding such diseases; and

(C) reflect input from a broad range of scientists, patients, and advocacy groups.

#### (2) Certain elements of plan ####
