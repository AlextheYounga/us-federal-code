#### Ex. Ord. No. 14120. Advancing Women's Health Research and Innovation ####

Ex. Ord. No. 14120, Mar. 18, 2024, 89 F.R. 20095, provided:

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:

Section 1. *Policy*. My Administration is committed to getting women the answers they need about their health. For far too long, scientific and biomedical research excluded women and undervalued the study of women's health. The resulting research gaps mean that we know far too little about women's health across women's lifespans, and those gaps are even more prominent for women of color, older women, and women with disabilities.

The notion of including women in clinical trials used to be revolutionary—which means many diagnostics and treatments were developed without women in mind and thus failed to account for women's health. Over 30 years ago, the Congress passed the landmark National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 (Public Law 103–43) [see Tables for classification] to direct the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the largest public funder of biomedical research in the world, to include women and people of color in NIH-funded clinical research. In 2016, the Congress built on these requirements in the 21st Century Cures Act (Public Law 114–255) [see Tables for classification], which directed the NIH to further its pursuit of women's health research, including by strengthening clinical trial inclusion and data analysis, developing research and data standards to advance the study of women's health, and improving NIH-wide coordination on women's health research.

These policies led to significant increases in women's participation in clinical trials, and ongoing investments in biomedical research have supported breakthroughs in women's health. Through the discovery of genetic factors that increase the risk of breast cancer and innovations in mammography, we have transformed our approach to prevention, early detection, and treatment, and have improved outcomes for women facing a breast cancer diagnosis. We have improved access to life-saving treatments for women with severe heart failure by ensuring that the devices they need are the right size for a woman's body. We have also identified some of the most characteristic symptoms of heart attack in women, which are different from those in men—discoveries that have helped deliver faster treatment to women when every second counts. This is what we can achieve when we invest in women's health research.

It is time, once again, to pioneer the next generation of discoveries in women's health. My Administration seeks to fundamentally change how we approach and fund women's health research in the United States. That is why I established the first-ever White House Initiative on Women's Health Research (Initiative)—which is within the Office of the First Lady and includes a wide array of executive departments and agencies (agencies) and White House offices—to accelerate research that will provide the tools we need to prevent, diagnose, and treat conditions that affect women uniquely, disproportionately, or differently.

Together with the First Lady's tireless efforts, the Initiative is already galvanizing the Federal Government to advance women's health, including through investments in innovation and improved coordination within and across agencies. We are also mobilizing leaders across a wide range of sectors, including industry, philanthropy, and the medical and research communities, to improve women's health.

It is the policy of my Administration to advance women's health research, close health disparities, and ensure that the gains we make in research laboratories are translated into real-world clinical benefits for women. It is also the policy of my Administration to ensure that women have access to high-quality, evidence-based health care and to improve health outcomes for women across their lifespans and throughout the country.

I will continue to call on the Congress to provide the transformative investments necessary to help our researchers and scientists answer today's most pressing questions related to women's health. Investing in innovation in women's health is an investment in the future of American families and the economy. At the same time, agencies must use their existing authorities to advance and integrate women's health across the Federal research portfolio, close research gaps, and make investments that maximize our ability to prevent, diagnose, and treat health conditions in women.

Sec. 2. *Definitions*. For purposes of this order:

(a) The term "women's health research" means research aimed at expanding knowledge of women's health across their lifespans, which includes the study and analysis of conditions specific to women, conditions that disproportionately impact women, and conditions that affect women differently.

#### White House Initiative on Women's Health Research ####

Memorandum of President of the United States, Nov. 13, 2023, 88 F.R. 80085, provided:

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:

Section 1. *Policy*. Women make up half of the United States population, but for too long, a lack of timely research and data on women's health has left health care providers without important tools to diagnose and treat millions of women with debilitating conditions, including cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, autoimmune disorders, mental health conditions, and conditions specific to women such as endometriosis and fibroids.

Beyond the immediate health consequences, underinvesting in women's health research can decrease women's well-being and quality of life, hold women back in the workplace, and affect their families' economic security. By contrast, increasing investments in women's health research can yield broad societal gains, including lower health care costs and a more productive and inclusive workforce.

To address pervasive gaps in our knowledge of women's health, we must accelerate research on the unique health needs of women across their lifespans. Research gaps are especially acute for diseases and conditions that are more prevalent among women and for health conditions associated with women's midlife and later years, including perimenopause and menopause. Gaps are often even more significant for those who have been historically underrepresented in, or excluded from, research.

We can—and must—increase our efforts to invest in research that maximizes our ability to prevent, diagnose, and treat health conditions in women across the United States. Meaningful progress requires robust, dedicated research infrastructure—including a strong, diverse research workforce—and investment within and beyond the Federal Government. We all have a part to play in galvanizing women's health research, developing innovative and cutting-edge interventions that promote women's health, and ensuring that women across the United States have access to high-quality health care.
