#### (1) Authority to award grants ####

The Secretary shall award grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements to State substance use disorder agencies, units of local government, nonprofit organizations, and Indian Tribes and Tribal organizations (as defined in section 5304 of title 25) that have a high rate, or have had a rapid increase, in the use of heroin or other opioids, in order to permit such entities to expand activities, including an expansion in the availability of evidence-based medication-assisted treatment and other clinically appropriate services, with respect to the treatment of substance use disorders in the specific geographical areas of such entities where there is a high rate or rapid increase in the use of heroin or other opioids, such as in rural areas.

#### (2) Nature of activities ####

Funds awarded under paragraph (1) shall be used for activities that are based on reliable scientific evidence of efficacy in the treatment of problems related to heroin or other opioids.

#### (b) Application ####

To be eligible for a grant, contract, or cooperative agreement under subsection (a), an entity shall submit an application to the Secretary at such time, in such manner, and accompanied by such information as the Secretary may reasonably require.
