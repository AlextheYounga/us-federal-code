“(A) In general.—A group health plan, and a health insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage in connection with a group health plan, shall permit an employee who is eligible, but not enrolled, for coverage under the terms of the plan (or a dependent of such an employee if the dependent is eligible, but not enrolled, for coverage under such terms) to enroll for coverage under the terms of the plan if either of the following conditions is met:

“(i) Termination of Medicaid or CHIP coverage.—The employee or dependent is covered under a Medicaid plan under title XIX of the Social Security Act or under a State child health plan under title XXI of such Act and coverage of the employee or dependent under such a plan is terminated as a result of loss of eligibility for such coverage and the employee requests coverage under the group health plan (or health insurance coverage) not later than 60 days after the date of termination of such coverage.

#### Congressional Findings Relating to Exercise of Commerce Clause Authority; Severability ####

Pub. L. 104–191, title I, §195, Aug. 21, 1996, 110 Stat. 1991, provided that:

“(a) Findings Relating to Exercise of Commerce Clause Authority.—Congress finds the following in relation to the provisions of this title [enacting this subchapter and sections 1181 to 1183 and 1191 to 1191c of Title 29, Labor, amending sections 233, 300e, and 300bb–8 of this title and sections 1003, 1021, 1022, 1024, 1132, 1136, and 1144 of Title 29, and enacting provisions set out as notes under this section, section 300gg–92 of this title, and section 1181 of Title 29]:

“(1) Provisions in group health plans and health insurance coverage that impose certain preexisting condition exclusions impact the ability of employees to seek employment in interstate commerce, thereby impeding such commerce.

“(2) Health insurance coverage is commercial in nature and is in and affects interstate commerce.

“(3) It is a necessary and proper exercise of Congressional authority to impose requirements under this title on group health plans and health insurance coverage (including coverage offered to individuals previously covered under group health plans) in order to promote commerce among the States.

“(4) Congress, however, intends to defer to States, to the maximum extent practicable, in carrying out such requirements with respect to insurers and health maintenance organizations that are subject to State regulation, consistent with the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 [29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.].
