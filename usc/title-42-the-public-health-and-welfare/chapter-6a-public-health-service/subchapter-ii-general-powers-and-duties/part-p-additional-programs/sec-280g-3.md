### §280g–3. Prescription drug monitoring program ###

#### (a) Program ####

#### (1) In general ####

Each fiscal year, the Secretary, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in coordination with the heads of other departments and agencies as appropriate, shall support States or localities for the purpose of improving the efficiency and use of PDMPs, including—

(A) establishment and implementation of a PDMP;

(B) maintenance of a PDMP;

(C) improvements to a PDMP by—

(i) enhancing functional components to work toward—

(I) universal use of PDMPs among providers and their delegates, to the extent that State laws allow;

(II) more timely inclusion of data within a PDMP;

(III) active management of the PDMP, in part by sending proactive or unsolicited reports to providers to inform prescribing; and

(IV) ensuring the highest level of ease in use of and access to PDMPs by providers and their delegates, to the extent that State laws allow;

(ii) in consultation with the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, improving the intrastate interoperability of PDMPs by—

(I) making PDMPs more actionable by integrating PDMPs within electronic health records and health information technology infrastructure; and

(II) linking PDMP data to other data systems within the State, including—

(aa) the data of pharmacy benefit managers, medical examiners and coroners, and the State's Medicaid program;

(bb) worker's compensation data; and

(cc) prescribing data of providers of the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Indian Health Service within the State;

(iii) in consultation with the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, improving the interstate interoperability of PDMPs through—

(I) sharing of dispensing data in near-real time across State lines; and

(II) integration of automated queries for multistate PDMP data and analytics into clinical workflow to improve the use of such data and analytics by practitioners and dispensers; or

(iv) improving the ability to include treatment availability resources and referral capabilities within the PDMP.

#### (2) Legislation ####

As a condition on the receipt of support under this section, the Secretary shall require a State or locality to demonstrate that it has enacted legislation or regulations—

(A) to provide for the implementation of the PDMP; and

(B) to permit the imposition of appropriate penalties for the unauthorized use and disclosure of information maintained by the PDMP.

#### (b) PDMP strategies ####

The Secretary shall encourage a State or locality, in establishing, improving, or maintaining a PDMP, to implement strategies that improve—

(1) the reporting of dispensing in the State or locality of a controlled substance to an ultimate user so the reporting occurs not later than 24 hours after the dispensing event;

(2) the consultation of the PDMP by each prescribing practitioner, or their designee, in the State or locality before initiating treatment with a controlled substance, or any substance as required by the State to be reported to the PDMP, and over the course of ongoing treatment for each prescribing event;

(3) the consultation of the PDMP before dispensing a controlled substance, or any substance as required by the State to be reported to the PDMP;

(4) the proactive notification to a practitioner when patterns indicative of controlled substance misuse by a patient, including opioid misuse, are detected;

(5) the availability of data in the PDMP to other States, as allowable under State law; and

(6) the availability of nonidentifiable information to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for surveillance, epidemiology, statistical research, or educational purposes.

#### (c) Drug misuse and abuse ####

In consultation with practitioners, dispensers, and other relevant and interested stakeholders, a State receiving support under this section—

(1) shall establish a program to notify practitioners and dispensers of information that will help to identify and prevent the unlawful diversion or misuse of controlled substances;

(2) may, to the extent permitted under State law, notify the appropriate authorities responsible for carrying out drug diversion investigations if the State determines that information in the PDMP maintained by the State indicates an unlawful diversion or abuse of a controlled substance;

(3) may conduct analyses of controlled substance program data for purposes of providing appropriate State agencies with aggregate reports based on such analyses in as close to real-time as practicable, regarding prescription patterns flagged as potentially presenting a risk of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose, and other aggregate information, as appropriate and in compliance with applicable Federal and State laws and provided that such reports shall not include protected health information; and

(4) may access information about prescriptions, such as claims data, to ensure that such prescribing and dispensing history is updated in as close to real-time as practicable, in compliance with applicable Federal and State laws and provided that such information shall not include protected health information.

#### (d) Evaluation and reporting ####

As a condition on receipt of support under this section, the State shall report on interoperability with PDMPs of other States and Federal agencies, where appropriate, intrastate interoperability with health information technology systems such as electronic health records, health information exchanges, and e-prescribing, where appropriate, and whether or not the State provides automatic, up-to-date, or daily information about a patient when a practitioner (or the designee of a practitioner, where permitted) requests information about such patient.

#### (e) Evaluation and reporting ####

A State receiving support under this section shall provide the Secretary with aggregate nonidentifiable information, as permitted by State law, to enable the Secretary—

(1) to evaluate the success of the State's program in achieving the purpose described in subsection (a); or

(2) to prepare and submit to the Congress the report required by subsection (i)(2).

#### (f) Education and access to the monitoring system ####

A State receiving support under this section shall take steps to—

(1) facilitate prescribers and dispensers, and their delegates, as permitted by State law, to use the PDMP, to the extent practicable; and

(2) educate prescribers and dispensers, and their delegates on the benefits of the use of PDMPs.

#### (g) Electronic format ####

The Secretary may issue guidelines specifying a uniform electronic format for the reporting, sharing, and disclosure of information pursuant to PDMPs. To the extent possible, such guidelines shall be consistent with standards recognized by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology.

#### (h) Rules of construction ####
