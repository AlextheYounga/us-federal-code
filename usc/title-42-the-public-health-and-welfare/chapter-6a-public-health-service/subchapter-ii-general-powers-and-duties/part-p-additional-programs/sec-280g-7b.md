#### **Editorial Notes** ####

#### References in Text ####

Section 1001 of title 20, referred to in subsec. (b)(1)(A), was in the original "section 1001 of the Higher Education Act of 1965" and was translated as if it had read "section 101 of the Higher Education Act of 1965" to reflect the probable intent of Congress. Section 101 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is classified to section 1001 of Title 20, Education, and defines "institution of higher education".

#### Codification ####

Section was enacted as part of the Accelerating Access to Critical Therapies for ALS Act, and not as part of the Public Health Service Act which comprises this chapter.
