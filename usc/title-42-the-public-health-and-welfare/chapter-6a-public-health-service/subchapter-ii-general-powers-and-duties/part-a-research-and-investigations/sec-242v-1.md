The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and other national security experts, as appropriate, shall ensure that biomedical research conducted or supported by the National Institutes of Health and other relevant agencies and offices within the Department of Health and Human Services is conducted or supported in a manner that appropriately considers national security risks, including national security implications related to research involving the sequencing of human genomic information, and collection, analysis, or storage of identifiable, sensitive information, as defined in section 241(d)(4) of this title, and the potential misuse of such data. Not later than 2 years after December 29, 2022, the Secretary shall ensure that the National Institutes of Health and other relevant agencies and offices within the Department of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the heads of agencies and national security experts, including the Office of the National Security within the Department of Health and Human Services—

(B) consideration of funding for projects that may have national security implications takes into account the extent to which the country in which the proposed research will be conducted or supported poses a risk to the integrity of the United States biomedical research enterprise; and

(C) data access committees reviewing data access requests for projects that may have national security risks, as appropriate, include members with expertise in current and emerging national security threats, in order to make appropriate decisions, including related to access to such identifiable, sensitive information; and

(3) not later than 2 years after the framework and relevant policies are developed or reviewed and updated, as applicable, under paragraph (1), update data access and sharing policies related to human genomic data, as applicable, based on current and emerging national security threats.
