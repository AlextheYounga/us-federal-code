(1) identify ways to improve the protection of intellectual property and other proprietary information, as well as identifiable, sensitive information of participants in biomedical research and development, from national security risks and other applicable threats, including the identification of gaps in policies and procedures in such areas related to biomedical research and development supported by the Department of Health and Human Services, and make recommendations to institutions of higher education or other entities that have traditionally received Federal funding for biomedical research to protect such information;

(2) identify or develop strategies to prevent, mitigate, and address national security risks and threats in biomedical research and development supported by the Federal Government, including such threats associated with foreign talent programs, by countries seeking to exploit United States technology and other proprietary information as it relates to such biomedical research and development, and make recommendations for additional policies and procedures to protect such information;

(4) develop a framework to identify areas of biomedical research and development supported by the Federal Government that are emerging areas of interest for state actors and would compromise national security if they were to be subjected to undue foreign influence; and
