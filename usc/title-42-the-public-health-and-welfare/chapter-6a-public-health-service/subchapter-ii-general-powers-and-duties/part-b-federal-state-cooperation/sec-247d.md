#### Ex. Ord. No. 13995. Ensuring an Equitable Pandemic Response and Recovery ####

Ex. Ord. No. 13995, Jan. 21, 2021, 86 F.R. 7193, provided:

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to address the disproportionate and severe impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID–19) on communities of color and other underserved populations, it is hereby ordered as follows:

Section 1. *Purpose*. The COVID–19 pandemic has exposed and exacerbated severe and pervasive health and social inequities in America. For instance, people of color experience systemic and structural racism in many facets of our society and are more likely to become sick and die from COVID–19. The lack of complete data, disaggregated by race and ethnicity, on COVID–19 infection, hospitalization, and mortality rates, as well as underlying health and social vulnerabilities, has further hampered efforts to ensure an equitable pandemic response. Other communities, often obscured in the data, are also disproportionately affected by COVID–19, including sexual and gender minority groups, those living with disabilities, and those living at the margins of our economy. Observed inequities in rural and Tribal communities, territories, and other geographically isolated communities require a place-based approach to data collection and the response. Despite increased State and local efforts to address these inequities, COVID–19's disparate impact on communities of color and other underserved populations remains unrelenting.

Addressing this devastating toll is both a moral imperative and pragmatic policy. It is impossible to change the course of the pandemic without tackling it in the hardest-hit communities. In order to identify and eliminate health and social inequities resulting in disproportionately higher rates of exposure, illness, and death, I am directing a Government-wide effort to address health equity. The Federal Government must take swift action to prevent and remedy differences in COVID–19 care and outcomes within communities of color and other underserved populations.

Sec. 2. *COVID–19 Health Equity Task Force*. There is established within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) a COVID–19 Health Equity Task Force (Task Force).

(a) *Membership*. The Task Force shall consist of the Secretary of HHS; an individual designated by the Secretary of HHS to Chair the Task Force (COVID–19 Health Equity Task Force Chair); the heads of such other executive departments, agencies, or offices (agencies) as the Chair may invite; and up to 20 members from sectors outside of the Federal Government appointed by the President.

(i) Federal members may designate, to perform the Task Force functions of the member, a senior-level official who is a part of the member's agency and a full-time officer or employee of the Federal Government.

(ii) Nonfederal members shall include individuals with expertise and lived experience relevant to groups suffering disproportionate rates of illness and death in the United States; individuals with expertise and lived experience relevant to equity in public health, health care, education, housing, and community-based services; and any other individuals with expertise the President deems relevant. Appointments shall be made without regard to political affiliation and shall reflect a diverse set of perspectives.

(iii) Members of the Task Force shall serve without compensation for their work on the Task Force, but members shall be allowed travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by law for persons serving intermittently in the Government service (5 U.S.C. 5701–5707).

(iv) At the direction of the Chair, the Task Force may establish subgroups consisting exclusively of Task Force members or their designees under this section, as appropriate.

(b) *Mission and Work.*

(i) Consistent with applicable law and as soon as practicable, the Task Force shall provide specific recommendations to the President, through the Coordinator of the COVID–19 Response and Counselor to the President (COVID–19 Response Coordinator), for mitigating the health inequities caused or exacerbated by the COVID–19 pandemic and for preventing such inequities in the future. The recommendations shall include:

(A) recommendations for how agencies and State, local, Tribal, and territorial officials can best allocate COVID–19 resources, in light of disproportionately high rates of COVID–19 infection, hospitalization, and mortality in certain communities and disparities in COVID–19 outcomes by race, ethnicity, and other factors, to the extent permitted by law;

(B) recommendations for agencies with responsibility for disbursing COVID–19 relief funding regarding how to disburse funds in a manner that advances equity; and

(C) recommendations for agencies regarding effective, culturally aligned communication, messaging, and outreach to communities of color and other underserved populations.

(ii) The Task Force shall submit a final report to the COVID–19 Response Coordinator addressing any ongoing health inequities faced by COVID–19 survivors that may merit a public health response, describing the factors that contributed to disparities in COVID–19 outcomes, and recommending actions to combat such disparities in future pandemic responses.

(c) *Data Collection*. To address the data shortfalls identified in section 1 of this order, and consistent with applicable law, the Task Force shall:

(i) collaborate with the heads of relevant agencies, consistent with the Executive Order entitled "Ensuring a Data-Driven Response to COVID–19 and Future High-Consequence Public Health Threats," [Ex. Ord. No. 13994, set out above] to develop recommendations for expediting data collection for communities of color and other underserved populations and identifying data sources, proxies, or indices that would enable development of short-term targets for pandemic-related actions for such communities and populations;

(ii) develop, in collaboration with the heads of relevant agencies, a set of longer-term recommendations to address these data shortfalls and other foundational data challenges, including those relating to data intersectionality, that must be tackled in order to better prepare and respond to future pandemics; and

(iii) submit the recommendations described in this subsection to the President, through the COVID–19 Response Coordinator.

(d) *External Engagement*. Consistent with the objectives set out in this order and with applicable law, the Task Force may seek the views of health professionals; policy experts; State, local, Tribal, and territorial health officials; faith-based leaders; businesses; health providers; community organizations; those with lived experience with homelessness, incarceration, discrimination, and other relevant issues; and other stakeholders.

(e) *Administration*. Insofar as the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended ([former] 5 U.S.C. App.) [see 5 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.], may apply to the Task Force, any functions of the President under the Act, except for those in section 6 of the Act, shall be performed by the Secretary of HHS in accordance with the guidelines that have been issued by the Administrator of General Services. HHS shall provide funding and administrative support for the Task Force to the extent permitted by law and within existing appropriations. The Chair shall convene regular meetings of the Task Force, determine its agenda, and direct its work. The Chair shall designate an Executive Director of the Task Force, who shall coordinate the work of the Task Force and head any staff assigned to the Task Force.

(f) *Termination*. Unless extended by the President, the Task Force shall terminate within 30 days of accomplishing the objectives set forth in this order, including the delivery of the report and recommendations specified in this section, or 2 years from the date of this order [Jan. 21, 2021], whichever comes first.

Sec. 3. *Ensuring an Equitable Pandemic Response*. To address the inequities identified in section 1 of this order, it is hereby directed that:

(a) The Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of HHS, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the Secretary of Education, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the heads of all other agencies with authorities or responsibilities relating to the pandemic response and recovery shall, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law:

(i) consult with the Task Force to strengthen equity data collection, reporting, and use related to COVID–19;

(ii) assess pandemic response plans and policies to determine whether personal protective equipment, tests, vaccines, therapeutics, and other resources have been or will be allocated equitably, including by considering:

(A) the disproportionately high rates of COVID–19 infection, hospitalization, and mortality in certain communities; and

(B) any barriers that have restricted access to preventive measures, treatment, and other health services for high-risk populations;

(iii) based on the assessments described in subsection (a)(ii) of this section, modify pandemic response plans and policies to advance equity, with consideration to:

(A) the effect of proposed policy changes on the distribution of resources to, and access to health care by, communities of color and other underserved populations;

(B) the effect of proposed policy changes on agencies' ability to collect, analyze, and report data necessary to monitor and evaluate the impact of pandemic response plans and policies on communities of color and other underserved populations; and

(C) policy priorities expressed by communities that have suffered disproportionate rates of illness and death as a result of the pandemic;

(iv) strengthen enforcement of anti-discrimination requirements pertaining to the availability of, and access to, COVID–19 care and treatment; and

(v) partner with States, localities, Tribes, and territories to explore mechanisms to provide greater assistance to individuals and families experiencing disproportionate economic or health effects from COVID–19, such as by expanding access to food, housing, child care, or income support.

(b) The Secretary of HHS shall:

(i) provide recommendations to State, local, Tribal, and territorial leaders on how to facilitate the placement of contact tracers and other workers in communities that have been hardest hit by the pandemic, recruit such workers from those communities, and connect such workers to existing health workforce training programs and other career advancement programs; and

(ii) conduct an outreach campaign to promote vaccine trust and uptake among communities of color and other underserved populations with higher levels of vaccine mistrust due to discriminatory medical treatment and research, and engage with leaders within those communities.

Sec. 4. *General Provisions*. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:

(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or

(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

#### Ex. Ord. No. 14000. Supporting the Reopening and Continuing Operation of Schools and Early Childhood Education Providers ####

Ex. Ord. No. 14000, Jan. 21, 2021, 86 F.R. 7215, provided:

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, to ensure that students receive a high-quality education during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID–19) pandemic, and to support the safe reopening and continued operation of schools, child care providers, Head Start programs, and institutions of higher education, it is hereby ordered as follows:

Section 1. *Policy*. Every student in America deserves a high-quality education in a safe environment. This promise, which was already out of reach for too many, has been further threatened by the COVID–19 pandemic. School and higher education administrators, educators, faculty, child care providers, custodians and other staff, and families have gone above and beyond to support children's and students' learning and meet their needs during this crisis. Students and teachers alike have found new ways to teach and learn. Many child care providers continue to provide care and learning opportunities to children in homes and centers across the country. However, leadership and support from the Federal Government is needed. Two principles should guide the Federal Government's response to the COVID–19 crisis with respect to schools, child care providers, Head Start programs, and higher education institutions. First, the health and safety of children, students, educators, families, and communities is paramount. Second, every student in the United States should have the opportunity to receive a high-quality education, during and beyond the pandemic.

Accordingly, it is the policy of my Administration to provide support to help create the conditions for safe, in-person learning as quickly as possible; ensure high-quality instruction and the delivery of essential services often received by students and young children at school, institutions of higher education, child care providers, and Head Start programs; mitigate learning loss caused by the pandemic; and address educational disparities and inequities that the pandemic has created and exacerbated.

Sec. 2. *Agency Roles and Responsibilities*. The following assignments of responsibility shall be exercised in furtherance of the policy described in section 1 of this order:

(a) The Secretary of Education shall, consistent with applicable law:

(i) provide, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, evidence-based guidance to assist States and elementary and secondary schools in deciding whether and how to reopen, and how to remain open, for in-person learning; and in safely conducting in-person learning, including by implementing mitigation measures such as cleaning, masking, proper ventilation, and testing;

(ii) provide, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, evidence-based guidance to institutions of higher education on safely reopening for in-person learning, which shall take into account considerations such as the institution's setting, resources, and the population it serves;

(iii) provide advice to State, local, Tribal, and territorial educational authorities, institutions of higher education, local education agencies, and elementary and secondary schools regarding distance and online learning, blended learning, and in-person learning; and the promotion of mental health, social-emotional well-being, and communication with parents and families;

(iv) develop a Safer Schools and Campuses Best Practices Clearinghouse to enable schools and institutions of higher education to share lessons learned and best practices for operating safely during the pandemic;

(v) provide technical assistance to schools and institutions of higher education so that they can ensure high-quality learning during the pandemic;

(vi) direct the Department of Education's Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights to deliver a report as soon as practicable on the disparate impacts of COVID–19 on students in elementary, secondary, and higher education, including those attending historically black colleges and universities, Tribal colleges and universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, and other minority-serving institutions;

(vii) coordinate with the Director of the Institute of Education Sciences to facilitate, consistent with applicable law, the collection of data necessary to fully understand the impact of the COVID–19 pandemic on students and educators, including data on the status of in-person learning. These data shall be disaggregated by student demographics, including race, ethnicity, disability, English-language-learner status, and free or reduced lunch status or other appropriate indicators of family income; and

(viii) consult with those who have been struggling for months with the enormous challenges the COVID–19 pandemic poses for education, including students; educators; unions; families; State, local, Tribal, and territorial officials; and members of civil rights and disability rights organizations, in carrying out the directives in this order.

(b) The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall, consistent with applicable law:

(i) facilitate the collection of data needed to inform the safe reopening and continued operation of elementary and secondary schools, child care providers, and Head Start programs, and ensure that such data are readily available to State, local, Tribal, and territorial leaders and the public, consistent with privacy interests, and that such data are disaggregated by race, ethnicity, and other factors as appropriate;

(ii) ensure, in coordination with the Coordinator of the COVID–19 Response and Counselor to the President (COVID–19 Response Coordinator) and other relevant agencies, that COVID–19-related supplies the Secretary administers, including testing materials, are equitably allocated to elementary and secondary schools, child care providers, and Head Start programs to support in-person care and learning;

(iii) to the maximum extent possible, support the development and operation of contact tracing programs at the State, local, Tribal, and territorial level, by providing guidance and technical support to ensure that contact tracing is available to facilitate the reopening and safe operation of elementary and secondary schools, child care providers, Head Start programs, and institutions of higher education;

(iv) provide guidance needed for child care providers and Head Start programs for safely reopening and operating, including procedures for mitigation measures such as cleaning, masking, proper ventilation, and testing, as well as guidance related to meeting the needs of children, families, and staff who have been affected by the COVID–19 pandemic, including trauma-informed care, behavioral and mental health support, and family support, as appropriate; and

(v) provide technical assistance to States, localities, Tribes, and territories to support the accelerated distribution of Federal COVID–19 relief funds to child care providers, and identify strategies to help child care providers safely remain open during the pandemic and beyond while the sector experiences widespread financial disruption due to increased costs and less revenue.

(c) The Secretary of Education and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and the COVID–19 Response Coordinator identifying strategies to address the impact of COVID–19 on educational outcomes, especially along racial and socioeconomic lines, and shall share those strategies with State, local, Tribal, and territorial officials. In developing these strategies, the Secretaries shall, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, consult with such officials, as well as with education experts; educators; unions; civil rights advocates; Tribal education experts; public health experts; child development experts; early educators, including child care providers; Head Start staff; school technology practitioners; foundations; families; students; community advocates; and others.

(d) The Federal Communications Commission is encouraged, consistent with applicable law, to increase connectivity options for students lacking reliable home broadband, so that they can continue to learn if their schools are operating remotely.

Sec. 3. *General Provisions*. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:

(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or

(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

#### Addressing the Long-Term Effects of COVID–19 ####

Memorandum of President of the United States, Apr. 5, 2022, 87 F.R. 20995, provided:

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:

Section 1. *Policy*. My Administration has made combating the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID–19) pandemic, and guiding the Nation through the worst public health crisis in more than a century, our top priority. When I came into office, COVID–19 was wreaking havoc on our country—closing our businesses, keeping our kids out of school, and forcing us into isolation. Today, America has the tools to protect against COVID–19 and to dramatically decrease its risks. We move towards a future in which COVID–19 does not disrupt our daily lives and is something we prevent, protect against, and treat.

As we chart the path forward, we remember the more than 950,000 people in the United States lost to COVID–19. They were beloved parents, grandparents, children, siblings, spouses, neighbors, and friends. More than 200,000 children in the United States have lost a parent or caregiver to the disease. Each soul is irreplaceable, and the families and communities left behind are still reeling from profound loss. Many families and communities have already received support from Federal programs that help with the loss they have experienced. As we move forward, we commit to ensuring that families and communities can access these support programs and connect to resources they may need to help with their healing, health, and well-being.

At the same time, many of our family members, neighbors, and friends continue to experience negative long-term effects of COVID–19. Many individuals report debilitating, long-lasting effects of having been infected with COVID–19, often called "long COVID." These symptoms can happen to anyone who has had COVID–19—including individuals across ages, races, genders, and ethnicities; individuals with or without disabilities; individuals with or without underlying health conditions; and individuals whether or not they had initial symptoms. Individuals experiencing long COVID report experiencing new or recurrent symptoms, which can include anxiety and depression, fatigue, shortness of breath, difficulty concentrating, heart palpitations, disordered sleep, chest and joint pain, headaches, and other symptoms. These symptoms can persist long after the acute COVID–19 infection has resolved. Even young people and otherwise healthy people have reported long COVID symptoms that last for many months. These symptoms may be affecting individuals' ability to work, conduct daily activities, engage in educational activities, and participate in their communities. Our world-class research and public health organizations have begun the difficult work of understanding these new conditions, their causes, and potential prevention and treatment options. Our health care and support programs are working to help meet the needs of individuals experiencing the lasting effects of COVID–19. To organize the Federal Government's response, executive departments and agencies (agencies) must work together to use the expertise, resources, and benefit programs of the Federal Government to ensure that we are accelerating scientific progress and providing individuals with the support and services they need.

In addition, the American public is grappling with a mental health crisis exacerbated by the pandemic. Too many have felt the effects of social isolation, sickness, economic insecurity, increased caregiver burdens, and grief. My Administration has made significant investments in mental health as well as substance use disorder prevention, treatment, and recovery support for the American public, including by expanding access to community-based behavioral health services. We are committed to advancing these behavioral health efforts in order to better identify the effects of the pandemic on mental health, substance use, and well-being, and to take steps to address these effects for the people we serve.

Our Nation can continue to protect the public—and spare countless families from the deepest pain imaginable—if everybody does their part. Today, we have numerous tools to protect ourselves and our loved ones from COVID–19—from vaccines to tests, treatments, masks, and more. My Administration recognizes the toll of this pandemic on the American public and commits to redoubling our efforts to support the American people in addressing the long-term effects of COVID–19 on their lives and on society.

Sec. 2. *Organizing the Government-Wide Response to the Long-Term Effects of COVID–19*. (a) The Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) shall coordinate the Government-wide response to the long-term effects of COVID–19. My Administration will harness the full potential of the Federal Government, in coordination with public- and private-sector partners, to mount a full and effective response. The Secretary shall report on the coordination efforts to the Coordinator of the COVID–19 Response and Counselor to the President and to the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy.

(b) The heads of agencies shall assist and provide information to the Secretary, consistent with applicable law, as may be necessary to carry out the Secretary's duties described in subsection (a) of this section.

(c) In performing the duties described in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall seek information from relevant nongovernmental experts, organizations, and stakeholders, including individuals affected directly by the long-term effects of COVID–19. The Secretary shall consider using all available legal authorities, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to assist in gathering relevant information, including a waiver under 42 U.S.C. 247d(f).

Sec. 3. *Report on the Long-Term Effects of COVID–19*. The Secretary, supported within the Department of Health and Human Services by the Assistant Secretary for Health and the Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use, shall publish a public report within 120 days of the date of this memorandum [Apr. 5, 2022] outlining services and mechanisms of support across agencies to assist the American public in the face of the far-reaching and long-term effects of COVID–19. The report shall outline Federal Government services to support individuals experiencing long COVID, individuals and families experiencing a loss due to COVID–19, and all those grappling with mental health and substance use issues in the wake of this pandemic. The report shall also specifically address the long-term effects of COVID–19 on underserved communities and efforts to address disparities in availability and adoption of services and support for such communities.

Sec. 4. *National Research Action Plan on Long COVID*. (a) Coordinated efforts across the public and private sectors are needed to advance progress in prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and provision of services for individuals experiencing long COVID. The Secretary, supported by the Assistant Secretary for Health and in collaboration with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Energy, and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, shall coordinate a Government-wide effort to develop the first-ever interagency national research agenda on long COVID, to be reflected in a National Research Action Plan. The National Research Action Plan will build on ongoing efforts across the Federal Government, including the landmark RECOVER Initiative implemented by the National Institutes of Health. The Secretary shall release the jointly developed National Research Action Plan within 120 days of the date of this memorandum.

(b) The National Research Action Plan shall build upon existing research efforts and include strategies to:

(i) help measure and characterize long COVID in both children and adults, including with respect to its frequency, severity, duration, risk factors, and trends over time;

(ii) support the development of estimates on prevalence and incidence of long COVID disaggregated by demographic groups and symptoms;

(iii) better understand the epidemiology, course of illness, risk factors, and vaccine effectiveness in prevention of long COVID;

(iv) advance our understanding of the health and socioeconomic burdens on individuals affected by long COVID, including among different race and ethnicity groups, pregnant people, and those with underlying disabilities;

(v) foster development of new treatments and care models for long COVID based on a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of the SARS–CoV–2 virus;

(vi) inform decisions related to high-quality support, services, and interventions for long COVID;

(vii) improve data-sharing between agencies and academic and industry researchers about long COVID, to the extent permitted by law; and

(viii) specifically account for the pandemic's effect on underserved communities and rural populations.

Sec. 5. *General Provisions*. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:

(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or

(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

(c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

(d) The Secretary is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.
