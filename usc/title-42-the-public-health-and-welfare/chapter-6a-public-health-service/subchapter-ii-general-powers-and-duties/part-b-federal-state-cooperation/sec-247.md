The Secretary may establish a program, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, consisting of awarding demonstration grants to States to streamline State requirements and procedures in order to assist veterans who held certain military occupational specialties related to medical care or who have completed certain medical training while serving in the Armed Forces of the United States to meet certification, licensure, and other requirements applicable to civilian health care professions (such as emergency medical technician, paramedic, licensed practical nurse, registered nurse, physical therapy assistant, or physician assistant professions) in the State.

In determining the eligible military occupational specialties or training courses and the assistance required as described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Veterans' Employment and Training, and shall collaborate with the initiatives carried out under section 4114 of title 38 and sections 1142 through 1144 of title 10.

(B) identifying methods, such as waivers, for veterans who served in medical related fields while a member of the Armed Forces of the United States to forgo or meet any such equivalent State requirements; and
