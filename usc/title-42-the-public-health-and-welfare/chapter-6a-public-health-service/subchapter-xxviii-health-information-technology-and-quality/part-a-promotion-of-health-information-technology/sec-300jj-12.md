### §300jj–12. Health Information Technology Advisory Committee ###

#### (a) Establishment ####

There is established a Health Information Technology Advisory Committee (referred to in this section as the "HIT Advisory Committee") to recommend to the National Coordinator, consistent with the implementation of the strategic plan described in section 300jj–11(c)(3) of this title, policies, and, for purposes of adoption under section 300jj–14 of this title, standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria, relating to the implementation of a health information technology infrastructure, nationally and locally, that advances the electronic access, exchange, and use of health information. Such Committee shall serve to unify the roles of, and replace, the HIT Policy Committee and the HIT Standards Committee, as in existence before December 13, 2016.

#### (b) Duties ####

#### (1) Recommendations on policy framework to advance an interoperable health information technology infrastructure ####

#### (A) In general ####

The HIT Advisory Committee shall recommend to the National Coordinator a policy framework for adoption by the Secretary consistent with the strategic plan under section 300jj–11(c)(3) of this title for advancing the target areas described in this subsection. Such policy framework shall seek to prioritize achieving advancements in the target areas specified in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (2) and may, to the extent consistent with this section, incorporate policy recommendations made by the HIT Policy Committee, as in existence before December 13, 2016.

#### (B) Updates ####

The HIT Advisory Committee shall propose updates to such recommendations to the policy framework and make new recommendations, as appropriate.

#### (2) General duties and target areas ####

#### (A) In general ####

The HIT Advisory Committee shall recommend to the National Coordinator for purposes of adoption under section 300jj–14 of this title, standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria and an order of priority for the development, harmonization, and recognition of such standards, specifications, and certification criteria. Such recommendations shall include recommended standards, architectures, and software schemes for access to electronic individually identifiable health information across disparate systems including user vetting, authentication, privilege management, and access control.

#### (B) Priority target areas ####

For purposes of this section, the HIT Advisory Committee shall make recommendations under subparagraph (A) with respect to at least each of the following target areas:

(i) Achieving a health information technology infrastructure, nationally and locally, that allows for the electronic access, exchange, and use of health information, including through technology that provides accurate patient information for the correct patient, including exchanging such information, and avoids the duplication of patient records.

(ii) The promotion and protection of privacy and security of health information in health information technology, including technologies that allow for an accounting of disclosures and protections against disclosures of individually identifiable health information made by a covered entity for purposes of treatment, payment, and health care operations (as such terms are defined for purposes of the regulation promulgated under section 264(c) of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996), including for the segmentation and protection from disclosure of specific and sensitive individually identifiable health information with the goal of minimizing the reluctance of patients to seek care.

(iii) The facilitation of secure access by an individual to such individual's protected health information and access to such information by a family member, caregiver, or guardian acting on behalf of a patient, including due to age-related and other disability, cognitive impairment, or dementia.

(iv) Subject to subparagraph (D), any other target area that the HIT Advisory Committee identifies as an appropriate target area to be considered under this subparagraph.

#### (C) Additional target areas ####

For purposes of this section, the HIT Advisory Committee may make recommendations under subparagraph (A), in addition to areas described in subparagraph (B), with respect to any of the following areas:

(i) The use of health information technology to improve the quality of health care, such as by promoting the coordination of health care and improving continuity of health care among health care providers, reducing medical errors, improving population health, reducing chronic disease, and advancing research and education.

(ii) The use of technologies that address the needs of children and other vulnerable populations.

(iii) The use of electronic systems to ensure the comprehensive collection of patient demographic data, including at a minimum, race, ethnicity, primary language, and gender information.

(iv) The use of self-service, telemedicine, home health care, and remote monitoring technologies.

(v) The use of technologies that meet the needs of diverse populations.

(vi) The use of technologies that support—

(I) data for use in quality and public reporting programs;

(II) public health; or

(III) drug safety.

(vii) The use of technologies that allow individually identifiable health information to be rendered unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable to unauthorized individuals when such information is transmitted in a health information network or transported outside of the secure facilities or systems where the disclosing covered entity is responsible for security conditions.

(viii) The use of a certified health information technology for each individual in the United States.

#### (D) Authority for temporary additional priority target areas ####

For purposes of subparagraph (B)(iv), the HIT Advisory Committee may identify an area to be considered for purposes of recommendations under this subsection as a target area described in subparagraph (B) if—

(i) the area is so identified for purposes of responding to new circumstances that have arisen in the health information technology community that affect the interoperability, privacy, or security of health information, or affect patient safety; and

(ii) at least 30 days prior to treating such area as if it were a target area described in subparagraph (B), the National Coordinator provides adequate notice to Congress of the intent to treat such area as so described.

#### (E) Focus of committee work ####
