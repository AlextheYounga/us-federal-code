(2) the State submits to the Secretary any recommendations received by the State from such council for modifications to the plan (without regard to whether the State has made the recommended modifications) and any comments concerning the annual report.

#### (b) Maintenance of effort regarding State expenditures for mental health ####

#### (1) In general ####

A funding agreement for a grant under section 300x of this title is that the State involved will maintain State expenditures for community mental health services at a level that is not less than the average level of such expenditures maintained by the State for the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which the State is applying for the grant.

#### (2) Exclusion of certain funds ####

The Secretary may exclude from the aggregate State expenditures under subsection (a), funds appropriated to the principle agency for authorized activities which are of a non-recurring nature and for a specific purpose.

#### (3) Waiver ####

#### (A) In general ####

The Secretary may, upon the request of a State, waive the requirement established in paragraph (1) in whole or in part if the Secretary determines that extraordinary economic conditions in the State in the fiscal year involved or in the previous fiscal year justify the waiver <sup><a href="#300x-4_1_target" name="300x-4_1">1</a></sup>

#### (ii) Alternative ####

A State that has failed to comply with paragraph (1) and would otherwise be subject to a reduction in the State's allotment under section 300x of this title may, upon request by the State, in lieu of having the amount of the allotment under section 300x of this title for the State reduced for the fiscal year of the grant, agree to comply with a negotiated agreement that is approved by the Secretary and carried out in accordance with guidelines issued by the Secretary. If a State fails to enter into or comply with a negotiated agreement, the Secretary may take action under this paragraph or the terms of the negotiated agreement.

#### (B) Submission of information to the secretary ####

The Secretary may make a grant under section 300x of this title for a fiscal year only if the State involved submits to the Secretary information sufficient for the Secretary to make the determination required in subparagraph (A)(i).
