The term "economically distressed area" means an area described in section 3161(a) of this title.

#### (3) Mine land ####

The term "mine land" means—

(A) land subject to titles IV and V of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 1231 et seq.; 30 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.); and

(B) land that has been claimed or patented subject to sections 2319 through 2344 of the Revised Statutes (commonly known as the "Mining Law of 1872") (30 U.S.C. 22 et seq.).

#### (4) Program ####

The term "program" means the demonstration program established under subsection (b).

#### (b) Establishment ####

The Secretary shall establish a program to demonstrate the technical and economic viability of carrying out clean energy projects on current and former mine land.

#### (c) Selection of demonstration projects ####

#### (1) In general ####

In carrying out the program, the Secretary shall select not more than 5 clean energy projects, to be carried out in geographically diverse regions, at least 2 of which shall be solar projects.

#### (2) Eligibility ####

To be eligible to be selected for participation in the program under paragraph (1), a clean energy project shall demonstrate, as determined by the Secretary, a technology on a current or former mine land site with a reasonable expectation of commercial viability.

#### (3) Priority ####

In selecting clean energy projects for participation in the program under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall prioritize clean energy projects that will—

(A) be carried out in a location where the greatest number of jobs can be created from the successful demonstration of the clean energy project;

(B) provide the greatest net impact in avoiding or reducing greenhouse gas emissions;

(C) provide the greatest domestic job creation (both directly and indirectly) during the implementation of the clean energy project;

(D) provide the greatest job creation and economic development in the vicinity of the clean energy project, particularly—

(i) in economically distressed areas; and

(ii) with respect to dislocated workers who were previously employed in manufacturing, coal power plants, or coal mining;

(E) have the greatest potential for technological innovation and commercial deployment;

(F) have the lowest levelized cost of generated or stored energy;

(G) have the lowest rate of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of electricity generated or stored; and

(H) have the shortest project time from permitting to completion.

#### (4) Project selection ####

The Secretary shall solicit proposals for clean energy projects and select clean energy project finalists in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Secretary of Labor.

#### (5) Compatibility with existing operations ####

Prior to selecting a clean energy project for participation in the program under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consult with, as applicable, mining claimholders or operators or the relevant Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement Abandoned Mine Land program office to confirm—

(A) that the proposed project is compatible with any current mining, exploration, or reclamation activities; and

(B) the valid existing rights of any mining claimholders or operators.

#### (d) Consultation ####

The Secretary shall consult with the Director of the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, acting through the Office of Brownfields and Land Revitalization, to determine whether it is necessary to promulgate regulations or issue guidance in order to prioritize and expedite the siting of clean energy projects on current and former mine land sites.

#### (e) Technical assistance ####

The Secretary shall provide technical assistance to project applicants selected for participation in the program under subsection (c) to assess the needed interconnection, transmission, and other grid components and permitting and siting necessary to interconnect, on current and former mine land where the project will be sited, any generation or storage with the electric grid.

#### (f) Authorization of appropriations ####

There is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary to carry out this section $500,000,000 for the period of fiscal years 2022 through 2026.
