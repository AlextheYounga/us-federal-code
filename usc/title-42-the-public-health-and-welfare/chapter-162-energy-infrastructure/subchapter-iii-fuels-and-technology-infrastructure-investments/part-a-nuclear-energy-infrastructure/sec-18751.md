### §18751. Infrastructure planning for micro and small modular nuclear reactors ###

#### (a) Definitions ####

In this section:

#### (1) Advanced nuclear reactor ####

 The term "advanced nuclear reactor" has the meaning given the term in section 16271(b) of this title.

#### (2) Isolated community ####

The term "isolated community" has the meaning given the term in section 17392(a) of this title.

#### (3) Micro-reactor ####

The term "micro-reactor" means an advanced nuclear reactor that has an electric power production capacity that is not greater than 50 megawatts.

#### (4) National Laboratory ####

The term "National Laboratory" has the meaning given the term in section 15801 of this title.

#### (5) Small modular reactor ####

The term "small modular reactor" means an advanced nuclear reactor—

(A) with a rated capacity of less than 300 electrical megawatts; and

(B) that can be constructed and operated in combination with similar reactors at a single site.

#### (b) Report ####

Not later than 180 days after November 15, 2021, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and the Committees on Energy and Commerce and Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives a report that describes how the Department could enhance energy resilience and reduce carbon emissions with the use of micro-reactors and small modular reactors.

#### (c) Elements ####

The report required by subsection (b) shall address the following:

(1) An evaluation by the Department of current resilience and carbon reduction requirements for energy for facilities of the Department to determine whether changes are needed to address—

(A) the need to provide uninterrupted power to facilities of the Department for at least 3 days during power grid failures;

(B) the need for protection against cyber threats and electromagnetic pulses; and

(C) resilience to extreme natural events, including earthquakes, volcanic activity, tornados, hurricanes, floods, tsunamis, lahars, landslides, seiches, a large quantity of snowfall, and very low or high temperatures.

(2) A strategy of the Department for using nuclear energy to meet resilience and carbon reduction goals of facilities of the Department.

(3) A strategy to partner with private industry to develop and deploy micro-reactors and small modular reactors to remote communities in order to replace diesel generation and other fossil fuels.

(4) An assessment by the Department of the value associated with enhancing the resilience of a facility of the Department by transitioning to power from micro-reactors and small modular reactors and to co-located nuclear facilities with the capability to provide dedicated power to the facility of the Department during a grid outage or failure.

(5) The plans of the Department—

(A) for deploying a micro-reactor and a small modular reactor to produce energy for use by a facility of the Department in the United States by 2026;

(B) for deploying a small modular reactor to produce energy for use by a facility of the Department in the United States by 2029; and

(C) to include micro-reactors and small modular reactors in the planning for meeting future facility energy needs.

#### (d) Financial and technical assistance for siting micro-reactors, small modular reactors, and advanced nuclear reactors ####

#### (1) In general ####

The Secretary shall offer financial and technical assistance to entities to conduct feasibility studies for the purpose of identifying suitable locations for the deployment of micro-reactors, small modular reactors, and advanced nuclear reactors in isolated communities.

#### (2) Requirement ####

Prior to providing financial and technical assistance under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall conduct robust community engagement and outreach for the purpose of identifying levels of interest in isolated communities.

#### (3) Limitation ####

The Secretary shall not disburse more than 50 percent of the amounts available for financial assistance under this subsection to the National Laboratories.
