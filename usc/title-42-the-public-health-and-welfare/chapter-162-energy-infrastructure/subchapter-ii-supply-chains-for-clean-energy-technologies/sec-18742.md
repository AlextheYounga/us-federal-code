(H)(i) hybrid vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of not less than 14,000 pounds; and

(ii) technologies, components, and materials for those vehicles; and

(I) other advanced energy property designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as may be determined by the Secretary.

#### (2) Covered census tract ####

The term "covered census tract" means a census tract—

(A) in which, after December 31, 1999, a coal mine had closed;

(B) in which, after December 31, 2009, a coal-fired electricity generating unit had been retired; or

(C) that is immediately adjacent to a census tract described in subparagraph (A) or (B).

#### (3) Eligible entity ####

The term "eligible entity" means a manufacturing firm—

(A) the gross annual sales of which are less than $100,000,000;

(B) that has fewer than 500 employees at the plant site of the manufacturing firm; and

(C) the annual energy bills of which total more than $100,000 but less than $2,500,000.

#### (4) Minority-owned ####

The term "minority-owned", with respect to an eligible entity, means an eligible entity not less than 51 percent of which is owned by 1 or more individuals who are—

(A) citizens of the United States; and

(B) Asian American, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, African American, Hispanic, Puerto Rican, Native American, or Alaska Native.

#### (5) Program ####

The term "Program" means the grant program established under subsection (b).

#### (6) Qualifying advanced energy project ####

The term "qualifying advanced energy project" means a project that—

(A)(i) re-equips, expands, or establishes a manufacturing or recycling facility for the production or recycling, as applicable, of advanced energy property; or

(ii) re-equips an industrial or manufacturing facility with equipment designed to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of that facility substantially below the greenhouse gas emissions under current best practices, as determined by the Secretary, through the installation of—

(I) low- or zero-carbon process heat systems;

(II) carbon capture, transport, utilization, and storage systems;

(III) technology relating to energy efficiency and reduction in waste from industrial processes; or

(IV) any other industrial technology that significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions, as determined by the Secretary;

(B) has a reasonable expectation of commercial viability, as determined by the Secretary; and

(C) is located in a covered census tract.

#### (b) Establishment ####

Not later than 180 days after November 15, 2021, the Secretary shall establish a program to award grants to eligible entities to carry out qualifying advanced energy projects.

#### (c) Applications ####

#### (1) In general ####

Each eligible entity seeking a grant under the Program shall submit to the Secretary an application at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary may require, including a description of the proposed qualifying advanced energy project to be carried out using the grant.

#### (2) Selection criteria ####

#### (A) Projects ####

In selecting eligible entities to receive grants under the Program, the Secretary shall, with respect to the qualifying advanced energy projects proposed by the eligible entities, give higher priority to projects that—

(i) will provide higher net impact in avoiding or reducing anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases;

(ii) will result in a higher level of domestic job creation (both direct and indirect) during the lifetime of the project;

(iii) will result in a higher level of job creation in the vicinity of the project, particularly with respect to—

(I) low-income communities (as described in section 45D(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986); and

(II) dislocated workers who were previously employed in manufacturing, coal power plants, or coal mining;

(iv) have higher potential for technological innovation and commercial deployment;

(v) have a lower levelized cost of—

(I) generated or stored energy; or

(II) measured reduction in energy consumption or greenhouse gas emission (based on costs of the full supply chain); and

(vi) have a shorter project time.

#### (B) Eligible entities ####

In selecting eligible entities to receive grants under the Program, the Secretary shall give priority to eligible entities that are minority-owned.

#### (d) Project completion and location; return of unobligated funds ####

#### (1) Completion; return of unobligated funds ####

An eligible entity that receives a grant under the Program shall be required—

(A) to complete the qualifying advanced energy project funded by the grant not later than 3 years after the date of receipt of the grant funds; and

(B) to return to the Secretary any grant funds that remain unobligated at the end of that 3-year period.

#### (2) Location ####

If the Secretary determines that an eligible entity awarded a grant under the Program has carried out the applicable qualifying advanced energy project at a location that is materially different from the location specified in the application for the grant, the eligible entity shall be required to return the grant funds to the Secretary.

#### (e) Technical assistance ####

#### (1) In general ####

Not later than 180 days after November 15, 2021, the Secretary shall provide technical assistance on a selective basis to eligible entities that are seeking a grant under the Program to enhance the impact of the qualifying advanced energy project to be carried out using the grant with respect to the selection criteria described in subsection (c)(2)(A).

#### (3) Factors for consideration ####

In selecting eligible entities for technical assistance under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall give higher priority to eligible entities that propose a qualifying advanced energy project that has greater potential for enhancement of the impact of the project with respect to the selection criteria described in subsection (c)(2)(A).

#### (f) Publication of grants ####
