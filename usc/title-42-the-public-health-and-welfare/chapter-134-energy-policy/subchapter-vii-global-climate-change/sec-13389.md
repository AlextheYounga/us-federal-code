#### **Editorial Notes** ####

#### References in Text ####

Section 15801(3) of this title, referred to in subsec. (a)(7), was in the original "section 3(3) of the Energy Policy Act of 2005" and was translated as meaning section 2(3) of that Act to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because the Energy Policy Act of 2005 does not contain a section 3 and section 2(3) defines "National Laboratory".

This subtitle, referred to in subsec. (j), appearing in the original, is unidentifiable because title XVI of Pub. L. 102–486, of which this section is a part, does not contain subtitles.
