The Secretary shall make adjustments in the consumption base level to account for an increase or reduction in units, a change in fuel source, a change in resident controlled electricity consumption, or for other reasons.

#### (iv) Savings ####

All cost savings resulting from an election made by a small public housing agency under this subparagraph—

(I) shall accrue to the small public housing agency; and
