#### (h) Resilience or mitigation project planning assistance ####

#### (1) In general ####

The President may provide financial, technical, or other assistance under this subchapter to an eligible entity that plans to perform a resilience or mitigation project within, or that primarily benefits, a community disaster resilience zone.

#### (2) Purpose ####

The purpose of assistance provided under paragraph (1) shall be to carry out activities in preparation for a resilience or mitigation project or seek an evaluation and certification under subsection (i)(2) for a resilience or mitigation project before the date on which permanent work of the resilience or mitigation project begins.

#### (2) Evaluation and certification ####

#### (A) In general ####

Not later than 120 days after the date on which an eligible entity submits an application under paragraph (1), the President shall evaluate the application to determine whether the resilience or mitigation project that the entity plans to perform within, or that primarily benefits, a community disaster resilience zone—
