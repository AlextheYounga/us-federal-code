(ii) serving as a Foundation-wide resource on project management, including providing expert assistance on nonscientific and nontechnical aspects of project planning, budgeting, implementation, management, and oversight;

(iii) coordinating and collaborating with research directorates to share best management practices and lessons learned from prior major multi-user research facility projects; and

(iv) assessing each major multi-user research facility project for cost and schedule risk; and

(H) appoint a senior agency official whose responsibility is oversight of the development, construction, and operations of major multi-user research facilities across the Foundation.

#### (b) Facilities full life-cycle costs ####

#### (1) In general ####

Subject to subsection (c)(1), the Director of the Foundation shall require that any pre-award analysis of a major multi-user research facility project includes the development and consideration of the full life-cycle cost (as defined in section 2 of the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 1998 (42 U.S.C. 1862k note)) in accordance with section 1862n–4 of this title.

#### (2) Implementation ####

Based on the pre-award analysis described in paragraph (1), the Director of the Foundation shall include projected operational costs within the Foundation's out-years as part of the President's annual budget submission to Congress under section 1105 of title 31.

#### (c) Cost oversight ####

#### (1) Pre-award analysis ####

#### (A) In general ####

The Director of the Foundation and the National Science Board may not approve or execute any agreement to start construction on any proposed major multi-user research facility project unless—

(i) an external analysis of the proposed budget has been conducted to ensure the proposal is complete and reasonable;

(ii) the analysis under clause (i) follows the Government Accountability Office Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide;

(iii) except as provided under subparagraph (C), an analysis of the accounting systems has been conducted;

(iv) an independent cost estimate of the construction of the project has been conducted using the same detailed technical information as the project proposal estimate to determine whether the estimate is well-supported and realistic; and

(v) the Foundation and the National Science Board have considered the analyses under clauses (i) and (iii) and the independent cost estimate under clause (iv) and resolved any major issues identified therein.

#### (B) Audits ####

An external analysis under subparagraph (A)(i) may include an audit.

#### (C) Exception ####
