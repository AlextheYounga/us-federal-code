#### Effective Date of 1998 Amendment ####

#### Findings ####

Pub. L. 115–402, §2, Dec. 31, 2018, 132 Stat. 5343, provided that: "Congress finds the following:

"(1) To remain competitive in the global economy, foster greater innovation, and provide a foundation for shared prosperity, the United States needs a workforce with the right mix of skills to meet the diverse needs of the economy.

"(2) Evidence indicates that the returns on investments in technical skills in the labor market are strong when students successfully complete their education and gain credentials sought by employers.

"(3) The responsibility for developing and sustaining a skilled technical workforce is fragmented across many groups, including educators, students, workers, employers, Federal, State, and local governments, civic associations, and other stakeholders. Such groups need to be able to coordinate and cooperate successfully with each other.

"(4) Coordination among students, community colleges, secondary and post-secondary institutions, and employers would improve educational outcomes.

"(5) Promising experiments currently underway may guide innovation and reform, but scalability of some of those experiments has not yet been tested.

"(6) Evidence suggests that integration of academic education, technical skills development, and hands-on work experience improves outcomes and return on investment for students in secondary and post-secondary education and for skilled technical workers in different career stages.

"(7) Outcomes show that mentoring can increase STEM student engagement and the rate of completion of STEM post-secondary degrees."
