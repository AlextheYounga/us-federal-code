(1) basic understanding of human social behavior;

(2) the neural basis of human cognition;

(3) basic understanding of cognitive, linguistic, social, cultural, and biological processes related to human development across the lifespan;

(4) basic understanding of perceptual, motor, and cognitive processes, and their interaction, in typical human behavior; and

(5) basic understanding of the relevance of drug and alcohol abuse.

#### Findings ####

Pub. L. 116–339, §2, Jan. 13, 2021, 134 Stat. 5126, provided that: "Congress finds the following:

"(1) The rate of Americans dying by suicide is on the rise, increasing 10.7 to 14.0 deaths per 100,000 people from 2001 to 2017.

"(2) Suicide is the tenth-leading cause of death among people in the United States and the second-leading cause of death for young people between the ages of 15 and 34.

"(3) The National Science Foundation funds research that is improving our basic understanding of factors with potential relevance to suicide, including potential relevance to prevention and treatment.

"(4) Despite progress in mental health research, current gaps exist in scientific understanding and basic knowledge of human neural, genetic, cognitive, perceptual, behavioral, social, and environmental factors with potential relevance to suicide."
