### §1862g. Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research ###

(a) The Director shall operate a program to stimulate competitive research (known as the "Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research"), the purpose of which is to assist those States that—

(1) historically have received relatively little Federal research and development funding; and

(2) have demonstrated a commitment to develop their research bases and improve science and engineering research and education programs at their universities and colleges.

(b) A State which has received an initial award under such Program, whether or not the award was received before or after October 31, 1988, shall be eligible for up to 5 years of additional support under the Program if that State provides assurances of new matching funds and submits an acceptable new plan for using Program funds and matching funds to build the research capabilities of the State.
