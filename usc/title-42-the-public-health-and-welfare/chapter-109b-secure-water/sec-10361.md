### §10361. Findings ###

Congress finds that—

(1) adequate and safe supplies of water are fundamental to the health, economy, security, and ecology of the United States;

(2) systematic data-gathering with respect to, and research and development of, the water resources of the United States will help ensure the continued existence of sufficient quantities of water to support—

(A) increasing populations;

(B) economic growth;

(C) irrigated agriculture;

(D) energy production; and

(E) the protection of aquatic ecosystems;

(3) global climate change poses a significant challenge to the protection and use of the water resources of the United States due to an increased uncertainty with respect to the timing, form, and geographical distribution of precipitation, which may have a substantial effect on the supplies of water for agricultural, hydroelectric power, industrial, domestic supply, and environmental needs;

(4) although States bear the primary responsibility and authority for managing the water resources of the United States, the Federal Government should support the States, as well as regional, local, and tribal governments, by carrying out—

(A) nationwide data collection and monitoring activities;

(B) relevant research; and

(C) activities to increase the efficiency of the use of water in the United States;

(5) Federal agencies that conduct water management and related activities have a responsibility—

(A) to take a lead role in assessing risks to the water resources of the United States (including risks posed by global climate change); and

(B) to develop strategies—

(i) to mitigate the potential impacts of each risk described in subparagraph (A); and

(ii) to help ensure that the long-term water resources management of the United States is sustainable and will ensure sustainable quantities of water;

(6) it is critical to continue and expand research and monitoring efforts—

(A) to improve the understanding of the variability of the water cycle; and

(B) to provide basic information necessary—

(i) to manage and efficiently use the water resources of the United States; and

(ii) to identify new supplies of water that are capable of being reclaimed; and

(7) the study of water use is vital—

(A) to the understanding of the impacts of human activity on water and ecological resources; and

(B) to the assessment of whether available surface and groundwater supplies will be available to meet the future needs of the United States.

"(A) establishing a website or data hub to exchange water data, including data on water quality or water technology, including new and emerging, but proven, water technology; and

"(B) intercounty communications initiatives related to water data.

"(2) Requirements.—

"(A) Data sharing.—The Internet of Water principles developed by the Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions shall, to the extent practicable, guide any water data sharing efforts under the pilot program.

"(B) Use of existing data.—The recipient of a grant under the pilot program to establish a website or data hub described in paragraph (1)(A) shall, to the extent practicable, leverage existing data sharing infrastructure.

"(b) Eligible Entities.—An entity eligible for a grant under the pilot program is—

"(1) a State, county, or other unit of local government that—

"(A) has a coastal watershed with significant pollution levels;

"(B) has a water system with significant pollution levels; or

"(C) has significant individual water infrastructure deficits; or

"(2) a regional consortium established under subsection (d).

"(c) Applications.—To be eligible to receive a grant under the pilot program, an eligible entity under subsection (b) shall submit to the Administrator an application at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Administrator may require.

"(d) Regional Consortia.—

"(1) Establishment.—States may establish regional consortia in accordance with this subsection.

"(2) Requirements.—A regional consortium established under paragraph (1) shall—

"(A) include not fewer than 2 States that have entered into a memorandum of understanding—

"(i) to exchange water data, including data on water quality; or

"(ii) to share information, protocols, and procedures with respect to projects that evaluate, demonstrate, or install new and emerging, but proven, water technology;

"(B) carry out projects—

"(i) to exchange water data, including data on water quality; or

"(ii) that evaluate, demonstrate, or install new and emerging, but proven, water technology; and

"(C) develop a regional intended use plan, in accordance with paragraph (3), to identify projects to carry out, including projects using grants received under this section.

"(3) Regional intended use plan.—A regional intended use plan of a regional consortium established under paragraph (1)—

"(A) shall identify projects that the regional consortium intends to carry out, including projects that meet the requirements of paragraph (2)(B); and

"(B) may include—

"(i) projects included in an intended use plan of a State prepared under section 606(c) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1386(c)) within the regional consortium; and

"(ii) projects not included in an intended use plan of a State prepared under section 606(c) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1386(c)) within the regional consortium.

"(e) Report.—Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act [Nov. 15, 2021], the Administrator shall submit to Congress a report that describes the implementation of the pilot program, which shall include—

"(1) a description of the use and deployment of amounts made available under the pilot program; and

"(2) an accounting of all grants awarded under the program, including a description of each grant recipient and each project funded using a grant under the pilot program.

"(f) Funding.—

"(1) Authorization of appropriations.—There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out the pilot program $15,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2022 through 2026, to remain available until expended.
