#### **Editorial Notes** ####

#### References in Text ####

The Endangered Species Act of 1973, referred to in subsec. (a)(1)(G), (H), is Pub. L. 93–205, Dec. 28, 1973, 87 Stat. 884, which is classified principally to chapter 35 (§1531 et seq.) of Title 16, Conservation. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under section 1531 of Title 16 and Tables.

Section 206 of the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015, referred to in subsec. (e), is section 206 of div. D of Pub. L. 113–235, which is set out as a note under section 620 of Title 43, Public Lands.

#### Codification ####

Pub. L. 116–260, §203 and §1106(d), both amended subsec. (e) of this section by striking "$530,000,000" and inserting different new dollar amounts. In addition, section 1106(d) inserted the following condition: "subject to the condition that $50,000,000 of that amount shall be used to carry out section 206 of the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015 (43 U.S.C. 620 note; Public Law 113–235)". The amendment by section 1106(d) could not be executed as written because "$530,000,000" no longer appeared in text after the amendment by section 203, and therefore, the text does not reflect the insertion of the condition. Pub. L. 117–103, §203, subsequently amended subsec. (e) as it read after the amendment by section 203 of Pub. L. 116–260.
