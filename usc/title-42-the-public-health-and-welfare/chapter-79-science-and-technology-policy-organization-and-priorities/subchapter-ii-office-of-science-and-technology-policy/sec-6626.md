The Office of Science and Technology Policy, in collaboration with Federal departments and agencies, shall establish an interagency working group to compile and summarize available research and best practices on how to promote diversity and inclusions in STEM fields and examine whether barriers exist to promoting diversity and inclusion within Federal agencies employing scientists and engineers.

#### (b) Responsibilities ####

The working group shall be responsible for reviewing and assessing research, best practices, and policies across Federal science agencies related to the inclusion of individuals identified in sections 1885a and 1885b of this title in the Federal STEM workforce, including available research and best practices on how to promote diversity and inclusion in STEM fields, including—

(1) policies providing flexibility for scientists and engineers that are also caregivers, particularly on the timing of research grants;

(2) policies to address the proper handling of claims of sexual harassment;

(3) policies to minimize the effects of implicit bias and other systemic factors in hiring, promotion, evaluation and the workplace in general; and

(4) other evidence-based strategies that the working group considers effective for promoting diversity and inclusion in the STEM fields.

(3) nonprofit research institutions;

(4) industry, including small businesses;

(5) federally funded research and development centers;

(6) non-governmental organizations; and

(7) such other members of the public interested in promoting a diverse and inclusive Federal STEM workforce.

#### (d) Public reports ####

Not later than 1 year after January 6, 2017, and periodically thereafter, the working group shall publish a report on the review and assessment under subsection (b), including a summary of available research and best practices, any recommendations for Federal actions to promote a diverse and inclusive Federal STEM workforce, and updates on the implementation of previous recommendations for Federal actions.
