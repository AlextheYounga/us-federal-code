### §17392. Micro-grid and integrated micro-grid systems program ###

#### (a) Definitions ####

In this section:

#### (1) Integrated micro-grid system ####

The term "integrated micro-grid system" means a micro-grid system that—

(A) comprises generation from both conventional and renewable energy resources; and

(B) may use grid-scale energy storage.

#### (2) Isolated community ####

The term "isolated community" means a community that is powered by a stand-alone electric generation and distribution system without the economic and reliability benefits of connection to a regional electric grid.

#### (3) Micro-grid system ####

The term "micro-grid system" means a localized grid that operates autonomously, regardless of whether the grid can operate in connection with another grid.

#### (4) Rural electric cooperative ####

The term "rural electric cooperative" means an electric cooperative (as defined in section 796 of title 16) that sells electric energy to persons in rural areas.

#### (5) Strategy ####

The term "strategy" means the strategy developed pursuant to subsection (b)(2)(B).

#### (b) Program ####

#### (1) Establishment ####

The Secretary of Energy (in this section referred to as the "Secretary") shall establish a program to promote the development of—

(A) integrated micro-grid systems for isolated communities; and

(B) micro-grid systems to increase the resilience of critical infrastructure.

#### (2) Requirements ####

The program established under paragraph (1) shall—

(A) develop a feasibility assessment for—

(i) integrated micro-grid systems in isolated communities; and

(ii) micro-grid systems to enhance the resilience of critical infrastructure;

(B) develop an implementation strategy, in accordance with paragraph (3), to promote the development of integrated micro-grid systems for isolated communities, particularly for those communities exposed to extreme weather conditions and high energy costs, including electricity, space heating and cooling, and transportation;

(C) develop an implementation strategy to promote the development of micro-grid systems that increase the resilience of critical infrastructure; and

(D) carry out cost-shared demonstration projects, based upon the strategies developed under subparagraph (B) that include the development of physical and cybersecurity plans to take appropriate measures to protect and secure the electric grid.

#### (3) Requirements for strategy ####

In developing the strategy under paragraph (2)(B), the Secretary shall consider—

(A) opportunities for improving the efficiency of existing integrated micro-grid systems;

(B) the capacity of the local workforce to operate, maintain, and repair a integrated micro-grid system as well as opportunities to improve that capacity;

(C) leveraging existing capacity within local or regional research organizations, such as organizations based at institutions of higher education, to support development of integrated micro-grid systems, including by testing novel components and systems prior to field deployment;

(D) the need for basic infrastructure to develop, deploy, and sustain a integrated micro-grid system;

(E) input of traditional knowledge from local leaders of isolated communities in the development of a integrated micro-grid system;

(F) the impact of integrated micro-grid systems on defense, homeland security, economic development, and environmental interests;

(G) opportunities to leverage existing interagency coordination efforts and recommendations for new interagency coordination efforts to minimize unnecessary overhead, mobilization, and other project costs; and

(H) any other criteria the Secretary determines appropriate.

#### (c) Collaboration ####

The program established under subsection (b)(1) shall be carried out in collaboration with relevant stakeholders, including, as appropriate—

(1) States;

(2) Indian Tribes;

(3) regional entities and regulators;

(4) units of local government;

(5) institutions of higher education; and

(6) private sector entities.

#### (d) Report ####

Not later than 180 days after December 27, 2020, and annually thereafter until calendar year 2029, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives a report on the efforts to implement the program established under subsection (b)(1) and the status of the strategy developed under subsection (b)(2)(B).

#### (e) Barriers and benefits to micro-grid systems ####

#### (1) Report ####

Not later than 270 days after December 27, 2020, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives a report on the benefits of, and barriers to, implementing resilient micro-grid systems that are—

(A)(i) owned or operated by an isolated community, rural electric cooperative, or municipal government; or

(ii) operated on behalf of a municipal government or rural electric cooperative; and

(B) designed to maximize the use of—

(i) energy-generation facilities owned or operated by isolated communities; or

(ii) a municipal or rural electric cooperative energy-generation facility.

#### (2) Grants to overcome barriers ####

The Secretary shall award grants of not more than $500,000 to not fewer than 20 municipal governments, rural electric cooperatives, or isolated communities, up to a total of $15,000,000, each year to assist those municipal governments, rural electric cooperatives, and isolated communities in overcoming the barriers identified in the report under paragraph (1).
