### §16161d. Clean hydrogen electrolysis program ###

#### (a) Definitions ####

In this section:

#### (1) Electrolysis ####

The term "electrolysis" means a process that uses electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen.

#### (2) Electrolyzer ####

The term "electrolyzer" means a system that produces hydrogen using electrolysis.

#### (3) Program ####

The term "program" means the program established under subsection (b).

#### (b) Establishment ####

Not later than 90 days after November 15, 2021, the Secretary shall establish a research, development, demonstration, commercialization, and deployment program for purposes of commercialization to improve the efficiency, increase the durability, and reduce the cost of producing clean hydrogen using electrolyzers.

#### (c) Goals ####

The goals of the program are—

(1) to reduce the cost of hydrogen produced using electrolyzers to less than $2 per kilogram of hydrogen by 2026; and

(2) any other goals the Secretary determines are appropriate.

#### (d) Demonstration projects ####

In carrying out the program, the Secretary shall fund demonstration projects—

(1) to demonstrate technologies that produce clean hydrogen using electrolyzers; and

(2) to validate information on the cost, efficiency, durability, and feasibility of commercial deployment of the technologies described in paragraph (1).

#### (e) Focus ####

The program shall focus on research relating to, and the development, demonstration, and deployment of—

(1) low-temperature electrolyzers, including liquid-alkaline electrolyzers, membrane-based electrolyzers, and other advanced electrolyzers, capable of converting intermittent sources of electric power to clean hydrogen with enhanced efficiency and durability;

(2) high-temperature electrolyzers that combine electricity and heat to improve the efficiency of clean hydrogen production;

(3) advanced reversible fuel cells that combine the functionality of an electrolyzer and a fuel cell;

(4) new highly active, selective, and durable electrolyzer catalysts and electro-catalysts that—

(A) greatly reduce or eliminate the need for platinum group metals; and

(B) enable electrolysis of complex mixtures with impurities, including seawater;

(5) modular electrolyzers for distributed energy systems and the bulk-power system (as defined in section 824o(a) of title 16);

(6) low-cost membranes or electrolytes and separation materials that are durable in the presence of impurities or seawater;

(7) improved component design and material integration, including with respect to electrodes, porous transport layers and bipolar plates, and balance-of-system components, to allow for scale-up and domestic manufacturing of electrolyzers at a high volume;

(8) clean hydrogen storage technologies;

(9) technologies that integrate hydrogen production with—

(A) clean hydrogen compression and drying technologies;

(B) clean hydrogen storage; and

(C) transportation or stationary systems; and

(10) integrated systems that combine hydrogen production with renewable power or nuclear power generation technologies, including hybrid systems with hydrogen storage.

#### (f) Grants, contracts, cooperative agreements ####

#### (1) Grants ####

In carrying out the program, the Secretary shall award grants, on a competitive basis, to eligible entities for projects that the Secretary determines would provide the greatest progress toward achieving the goal of the program described in subsection (c).

#### (2) Contracts and cooperative agreements ####

In carrying out the program, the Secretary may enter into contracts and cooperative agreements with eligible entities and Federal agencies for projects that the Secretary determines would further the purpose of the program described in subsection (b).

#### (3) Eligibility; applications ####

#### (A) In general ####

The eligibility of an entity to receive a grant under paragraph (1), to enter into a contract or cooperative agreement under paragraph (2), or to receive funding for a demonstration project under subsection (d) shall be determined by the Secretary.

#### (B) Applications ####

An eligible entity desiring to receive a grant under paragraph (1), to enter into a contract or cooperative agreement under paragraph (2), or to receive funding for a demonstration project under subsection (d) shall submit to the Secretary an application at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary may require.

#### (g) Authorization of appropriations ####

There is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary to carry out the program $1,000,000,000 for the period of fiscal years 2022 through 2026, to remain available until expended.
