### §16151. Purposes ###

The purposes of this subchapter are—

(1) to enable and promote comprehensive development, demonstration, and commercialization of hydrogen and fuel cell technology in partnership with industry;

(2) to make critical public investments in building strong links to private industry, institutions of higher education, National Laboratories, and research institutions to expand innovation and industrial growth;

(3) to build a mature hydrogen economy that creates fuel diversity in the massive transportation sector of the United States;

(4) to sharply decrease the dependency of the United States on imported oil, eliminate most emissions from the transportation sector, and greatly enhance our energy security; and

(5) to create, strengthen, and protect a sustainable national energy economy.
