### §16161a. Regional clean hydrogen hubs ###

#### (a) Definition of regional clean hydrogen hub ####

In this section, the term "regional clean hydrogen hub" means a network of clean hydrogen producers, potential clean hydrogen consumers, and connective infrastructure located in close proximity.

#### (b) Establishment of program ####

The Secretary shall establish a program to support the development of at least 4 regional clean hydrogen hubs that—

(1) demonstrably aid the achievement of the clean hydrogen production standard developed under section 16166(a) of this title;

(2) demonstrate the production, processing, delivery, storage, and end-use of clean hydrogen; and

(3) can be developed into a national clean hydrogen network to facilitate a clean hydrogen economy.

#### (c) Selection of regional clean hydrogen hubs ####

#### (1) Solicitation of proposals ####

Not later than 180 days after November 15, 2021, the Secretary shall solicit proposals for regional clean hydrogen hubs.

#### (2) Selection of hubs ####

Not later than 1 year after the deadline for the submission of proposals under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall select at least 4 regional clean hydrogen hubs to be developed under subsection (b).

#### (3) Criteria ####

The Secretary shall select regional clean hydrogen hubs under paragraph (2) using the following criteria:

#### (A) Feedstock diversity ####

To the maximum extent practicable—

(i) at least 1 regional clean hydrogen hub shall demonstrate the production of clean hydrogen from fossil fuels;

(ii) at least 1 regional clean hydrogen hub shall demonstrate the production of clean hydrogen from renewable energy; and

(iii) at least 1 regional clean hydrogen hub shall demonstrate the production of clean hydrogen from nuclear energy.

#### (B) End-use diversity ####

To the maximum extent practicable—

(i) at least 1 regional clean hydrogen hub shall demonstrate the end-use of clean hydrogen in the electric power generation sector;

(ii) at least 1 regional clean hydrogen hub shall demonstrate the end-use of clean hydrogen in the industrial sector;

(iii) at least 1 regional clean hydrogen hub shall demonstrate the end-use of clean hydrogen in the residential and commercial heating sector; and

(iv) at least 1 regional clean hydrogen hub shall demonstrate the end-use of clean hydrogen in the transportation sector.

#### (C) Geographic diversity ####

To the maximum extent practicable, each regional clean hydrogen hub—

(i) shall be located in a different region of the United States; and

(ii) shall use energy resources that are abundant in that region.

#### (D) Hubs in natural gas-producing regions ####

To the maximum extent practicable, at least 2 regional clean hydrogen hubs shall be located in the regions of the United States with the greatest natural gas resources.

#### (E) Employment ####

The Secretary shall give priority to regional clean hydrogen hubs that are likely to create opportunities for skilled training and long-term employment to the greatest number of residents of the region.

#### (F) Additional criteria ####

The Secretary may take into consideration other criteria that, in the judgment of the Secretary, are necessary or appropriate to carry out this subchapter <sup><a href="#16161a_1_target" name="16161a_1">1</a></sup>

#### (4) Funding of regional clean hydrogen hubs ####

The Secretary may make grants to each regional clean hydrogen hub selected under paragraph (2) to accelerate commercialization of, and demonstrate the production, processing, delivery, storage, and end-use of, clean hydrogen.

#### (d) Authorization of appropriations ####

There is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary to carry out this section $8,000,000,000 for the period of fiscal years 2022 through 2026.
