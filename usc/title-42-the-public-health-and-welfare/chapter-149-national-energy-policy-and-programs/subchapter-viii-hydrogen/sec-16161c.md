### §16161c. Clean hydrogen manufacturing and recycling ###

#### (a) Clean hydrogen manufacturing initiative ####

#### (1) In general ####

In carrying out the programs established under sections 16154 and 16161a of this title, the Secretary shall award multiyear grants to, and enter into contracts, cooperative agreements, or any other agreements authorized under this Act or other Federal law with, eligible entities (as determined by the Secretary) for research, development, and demonstration projects to advance new clean hydrogen production, processing, delivery, storage, and use equipment manufacturing technologies and techniques.

#### (2) Priority ####

In awarding grants or entering into contracts, cooperative agreements, or other agreements under paragraph (1), the Secretary, to the maximum extent practicable, shall give priority to clean hydrogen equipment manufacturing projects that—

(A) increase efficiency and cost-effectiveness in—

(i) the manufacturing process; and

(ii) the use of resources, including existing energy infrastructure;

(B) support domestic supply chains for materials and components;

(C) identify and incorporate nonhazardous alternative materials for components and devices;

(D) operate in partnership with tribal energy development organizations, Indian Tribes, Tribal organizations, Native Hawaiian community-based organizations, or territories or freely associated States; or

(E) are located in economically distressed areas of the major natural gas-producing regions of the United States.

#### (3) Evaluation ####
