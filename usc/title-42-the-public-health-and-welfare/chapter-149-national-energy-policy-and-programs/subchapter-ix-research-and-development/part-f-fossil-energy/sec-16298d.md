(iii) demonstrate in the application of the project for a prize—

(I) a design for a promising carbon capture technology that will—

(aa) be operated on a demonstration scale; and

(bb) have the potential to achieve significant reduction in the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere;

(II) a successful bench-scale demonstration of a carbon capture technology; or

(III) an operational carbon capture technology on a commercial scale.

#### (B) Commercial direct air capture projects ####

#### (i) In general ####

With respect to projects described in paragraph (2)(B), the Secretary shall award prizes under the prize competition to qualified direct air capture facilities for metric tons of qualified carbon dioxide captured and verified at the point of disposal, injection, or utilization.

#### (ii) Amount of award ####

The amount of the award per metric ton under clause (i)—

(I) shall be equal for each qualified direct air capture facility selected for a prize under the prize competition; and

(II) shall be determined by the Secretary and in any case shall not exceed—

(aa) $180 for qualified carbon dioxide captured and stored in saline storage formations;

(bb) a lesser amount, as determined by the Secretary, for qualified carbon dioxide captured and stored in conjunction with enhanced oil recovery operations; or

(cc) a lesser amount, as determined by the Secretary, for qualified carbon dioxide captured and utilized in any activity consistent with section 45Q(f)(5) of title 26.
