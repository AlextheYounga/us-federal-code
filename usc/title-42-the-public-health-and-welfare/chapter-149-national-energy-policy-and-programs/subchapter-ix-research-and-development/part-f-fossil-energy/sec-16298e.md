(2) inventories current and emerging approaches of carbon dioxide removal and evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of each of the approaches; and

(3) identifies recommendations for legislation, funding, rules, revisions to rules, financing mechanisms, or other policy tools that the Federal Government can use to sufficiently advance the deployment of carbon dioxide removal projects in order to meet, in the aggregate, the magnitude of needed removals estimated under paragraph (1), including policy tools, such as—

(A) grants;

(B) loans or loan guarantees;

(C) public-private partnerships;

(D) direct procurement;

(E) incentives, including subsidized Federal financing mechanisms available to project developers;

(C) to assist in preparing the report described in subsection (b) and any updates to the report under subsection (d); and

(D) to advise the Secretary on matters pertaining to carbon dioxide removal.

#### (2) Members and selection ####
