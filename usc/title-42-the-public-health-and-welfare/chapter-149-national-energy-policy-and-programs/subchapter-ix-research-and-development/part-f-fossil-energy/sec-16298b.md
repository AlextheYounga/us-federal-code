### §16298b. High efficiency turbines ###

#### (a) In general ####

The Secretary, acting through the Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy (referred to in this section as the "Secretary"), shall establish a multiyear, multiphase program (referred to in this section as the "program") of research, development, and technology demonstration to improve the efficiency of gas turbines used in power generation systems and aviation.

#### (b) Program elements ####

The program shall—

(1) support first-of-a-kind engineering and detailed gas turbine design for small-scale and utility-scale electric power generation, including—

(A) high temperature materials, including superalloys, coatings, and ceramics;

(B) improved heat transfer capability;

(C) manufacturing technology required to construct complex 3-dimensional geometry parts with improved aerodynamic capability;

(D) combustion technology to produce higher firing temperature while lowering nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide emissions per unit of output;

(E) advanced controls and systems integration;

(F) advanced high performance compressor technology; and

(G) validation facilities for the testing of components and subsystems;

(2) include technology demonstration through component testing, subscale testing, and full-scale testing in existing fleets;

(3) include field demonstrations of the developed technology elements to demonstrate technical and economic feasibility;

(4) assess overall combined cycle and simple cycle system performance;

(5) increase fuel flexibility by enabling gas turbines to operate with high proportions of, or pure, hydrogen or other renewable gas fuels;

(6) enhance foundational knowledge needed for low-emission combustion systems that can work in high-pressure, high-temperature environments required for high-efficiency cycles;

(7) increase operational flexibility by reducing turbine start-up times and improving the ability to accommodate flexible power demand; and

(8) include any other elements necessary to achieve the goals described in subsection (c), as determined by the Secretary, in consultation with private industry.

#### (c) Program goals ####

#### (1) In general ####

The goals of the program shall be—

(A) in phase I, to develop a conceptual design of, and to develop and demonstrate the technology required for—

(i) advanced high efficiency gas turbines to achieve, on a lower heating value basis—

(I) a combined cycle efficiency of not less than 65 percent; or

(II) a simple cycle efficiency of not less than 47 percent; and

(ii) aviation gas turbines to achieve a 25 percent reduction in fuel burn by improving fuel efficiency to existing best-in-class turbo-fan engines; and

(B) in phase II, to develop a conceptual design of advanced high efficiency gas turbines that can achieve, on a lower heating value basis—

(i) a combined cycle efficiency of not less than 67 percent; or

(ii) a simple cycle efficiency of not less than 50 percent.

#### (2) Additional goals ####

If a goal described in paragraph (1) has been achieved, the Secretary, in consultation with private industry and the National Academy of Sciences, may develop additional goals or phases for advanced gas turbine research and development.

#### (d) Financial assistance ####

#### (1) In general ####

The Secretary may provide financial assistance, including grants, to carry out the program.

#### (2) Proposals ####

Not later than 180 days after December 27, 2020, the Secretary shall solicit proposals from industry, small businesses, universities, and other appropriate parties for conducting activities under this section.

#### (3) Considerations ####

In selecting proposed projects to receive financial assistance under this subsection, the Secretary shall give special consideration to the extent to which the proposed project will—

(A) stimulate the creation or increased retention of jobs in the United States; and

(B) promote and enhance technology leadership in the United States.

#### (4) Competitive awards ####

The Secretary shall provide financial assistance under this subsection on a competitive basis, with an emphasis on technical merit.

#### (5) Cost sharing ####

Financial assistance provided under this subsection shall be subject to the cost sharing requirements of section 16352 of this title.

#### (e) Authorization of appropriations ####

There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section $50,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2021 through 2025.
