#### (b) Activities ####

Under the program described in subsection (a), the Secretary shall—

(1) assess and monitor—

(A) potential changes in lifecycle carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions; and

(B) other environmental safety indicators of new technologies, practices, processes, or methods used in enhanced hydrocarbon recovery as part of the activities authorized under section 16293 of this title;

(2) identify and evaluate novel uses for carbon (including conversion of carbon oxides) that, on a full lifecycle basis, achieve a permanent reduction, or avoidance of a net increase, in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, for use in commercial and industrial products such as—

(4) identify and assess alternative uses for coal that result in zero net emissions of carbon dioxide or other pollutants, including products derived from carbon engineering, carbon fiber, and coal conversion methods.

#### (c) Prioritization ####

In supporting demonstration and commercialization research under the program described in subsection (a), the Secretary shall prioritize consideration of projects that—

(1) have access to a carbon dioxide emissions stream generated by a stationary source in the United States that is capable of supplying not less than 250 metric tons per day of carbon dioxide for research;

(2) have access to equipment for testing small-scale carbon dioxide utilization technologies, with onsite access to larger test bays for scale-up; and

(3) have 1 or more existing partnerships with a National Laboratory, an institution of higher education, a private company, or a State or other government entity.

#### (d) Coordination ####

The Secretary shall coordinate the activities authorized under this section with the activities authorized in section 16298a of this title as part of a single consolidated program of the Department.

#### (e) Authorization of appropriations ####
