(ii) encourage the Commission to have such transportation package designs so certified by the Commission within 24 months after receipt of an application;

(D) shall consider options for acquiring or providing HA–LEU from a stockpile of uranium owned by the Department, or using enrichment technology, to make available to members of the consortium established pursuant to subparagraph (F) for commercial use or demonstration projects, taking into account cost and amount of time required, and prioritizing methods that would produce usable HA–LEU the quickest, including options for acquiring or providing HA–LEU—

(i) that—

(I) directly meets the needs of an end user; and

(II) has been previously used or fabricated for another purpose;

(ii) that meets the needs of an end user after having radioactive or other contaminants that resulted from a previous use or fabrication of the fuel for research, development, demonstration, or deployment activities of the Department removed;

(iii) that is produced from high-enriched uranium that is blended with lower assay uranium to become HA–LEU to meet the needs of an end user;

(iv) that is produced by Department research, development, and demonstration activities;

(v) that is produced in the United States by—

(I) a United States-owned commercial entity operating United States-origin technology;

(II) a United States-owned commercial entity operating a foreign-origin technology; or

(III) a foreign-owned entity operating a foreign-origin technology;

(vi) that does not require extraction of uranium or development of uranium from lands managed by the Federal Government, cause harm to the natural or cultural resources of Tribal communities or sovereign Native Nations, or result in degraded ground or surface water quality on publicly managed or privately owned lands; or

(vii) that does not negatively impact the availability of HA–LEU by the Department to support the production of medical isotopes, including the medical isotopes defined under the American Medical Isotopes Production Act of 2012 (Public Law 112–239; 126 Stat. 2211);

(E) not later than 1 year after December 27, 2020, and biennially thereafter, shall conduct a survey of stakeholders to estimate the quantity of HA–LEU necessary for domestic commercial use for each of the 5 subsequent years;

(F) shall establish, and from time to time update, a consortium, which may include entities involved in any stage of the nuclear fuel cycle, to partner with the Department to support the availability of HA–LEU for civilian domestic demonstration and commercial use, including by—

(i) providing information to the Secretary for purposes of surveys conducted under subparagraph (E);

(ii) purchasing HA–LEU made available by the Secretary to members of the consortium for commercial use under the program; and

(iii) carrying out demonstration projects using HA–LEU provided by the Secretary under the program;

(G) if applicable, shall, prior to acquiring or providing HA–LEU under subparagraph (H), in coordination with the consortium established pursuant to subparagraph (F), develop a schedule for cost recovery of HA–LEU made available to members of the consortium using HA–LEU for commercial use pursuant to subparagraph (H);

(H) shall, beginning not later than 3 years after the establishment of a consortium under subparagraph (F), have the capability to acquire or provide HA–LEU, in order to make such HA–LEU available to members of the consortium beginning not later than January 1, 2026, in amounts that are consistent, to the extent practicable, with—

(i) the quantities estimated under the surveys conducted under subparagraph (E); plus

(ii) the quantities necessary for demonstration projects carried out under the program, as determined by the Secretary;

(I) shall, for advanced reactor demonstration projects, prioritize the provision of HA–LEU made available under this section through a merit-based, competitive selection process; and

(J) shall seek to ensure that the activities carried out under this section do not cause any delay in the progress of any HA–LEU project between private industry and the Department that is underway as of December 27, 2020.
