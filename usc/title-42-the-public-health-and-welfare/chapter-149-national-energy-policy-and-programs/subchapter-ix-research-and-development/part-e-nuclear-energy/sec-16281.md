(i) providing information to the Secretary for purposes of surveys conducted under subparagraph (E);

(ii) purchasing HA–LEU made available by the Secretary to members of the consortium for commercial use under the program; and

(iii) carrying out demonstration projects using HA–LEU provided by the Secretary under the program;

(G) if applicable, shall, prior to acquiring or providing HA–LEU under subparagraph (H), in coordination with the consortium established pursuant to subparagraph (F), develop a schedule for cost recovery of HA–LEU made available to members of the consortium using HA–LEU for commercial use pursuant to subparagraph (H);

(H) shall, beginning not later than 3 years after the establishment of a consortium under subparagraph (F), have the capability to acquire or provide HA–LEU, in order to make such HA–LEU available to members of the consortium beginning not later than January 1, 2026, in amounts that are consistent, to the extent practicable, with—

(i) the quantities estimated under the surveys conducted under subparagraph (E); plus

(ii) the quantities necessary for demonstration projects carried out under the program, as determined by the Secretary;

(I) shall, for advanced reactor demonstration projects, prioritize the provision of HA–LEU made available under this section through a merit-based, competitive selection process; and
