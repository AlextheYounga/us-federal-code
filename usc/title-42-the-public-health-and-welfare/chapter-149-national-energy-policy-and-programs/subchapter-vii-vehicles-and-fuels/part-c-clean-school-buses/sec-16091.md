(II) .01 grams per brake horsepower-hour of particulate matter; or

(ii) clean school buses with engines manufactured in model year 2007 or thereafter that satisfy regulatory requirements established by the Administrator for emissions of oxides of nitrogen and particulate matter from school buses manufactured in that model year.

#### (6) Ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel ####

#### (A) <sup><a href="#16091_3_target" name="16091_3">3</a></sup> In general ####
