### §4015. Chargeable premium rates ###

#### (a) Establishment; terms and conditions ####

On the basis of estimates made under section 4014 of this title, and such other information as may be necessary, the Administrator shall from time to time prescribe, after providing notice—

(1) chargeable premium rates for any types and classes of properties for which insurance coverage shall be available under section 4012 of this title (at less than the estimated risk premium rates under section 4014(a)(1) of this title, where necessary), and

(2) the terms and conditions under which, and the areas (including subdivisions thereof) within which, such rates shall apply.

#### (b) Considerations for rates ####

Such rates shall, insofar as practicable, be—

(1) based on a consideration of the respective risks involved, including differences in risks due to land use measures, flood-proofing, flood forecasting, and similar measures;

(2) adequate, on the basis of accepted actuarial principles, to provide reserves for anticipated losses, or, if less than such amount, consistent with the objective of making flood insurance available where necessary at reasonable rates so as to encourage prospective insureds to purchase such insurance and with the purposes of this chapter;

(3) adequate, together with the fee under paragraph (1)(B)(iii) or (2) of section 4014(a) of this title, to provide for any administrative expenses of the flood insurance and floodplain management programs (including the costs of mapping activities under section 4101 of this title);

(4) stated so as to reflect the basis for such rates, including the differences (if any) between the estimated risk premium rates under section 4014(a)(1) of this title and the estimated rates under section 4014(a)(2) of this title; and

(5) adequate, on the basis of accepted actuarial principles, to cover the average historical loss year obligations incurred by the National Flood Insurance Fund.

#### (c) Actuarial rate properties ####

Subject only to the limitations provided under paragraphs (1) and (2), the chargeable rate shall not be less than the applicable estimated risk premium rate for such area (or subdivision thereof) under section 4014(a)(1) of this title with respect to the following properties:

#### (1) Post-firm properties ####

Any property the construction or substantial improvement of which the Administrator determines has been started after December 31, 1974, or started after the effective date of the initial rate map published by the Administrator under paragraph (2) of section 4101 of this title for the area in which such property is located, whichever is later, except that the chargeable rate for properties under this paragraph shall be subject to the limitation under subsection (e) of this section.

#### (2) Certain leased coastal and river properties ####

Any property leased from the Federal Government (including residential and nonresidential properties) that the Administrator determines is located on the river-facing side of any dike, levee, or other riverine flood control structure, or seaward of any seawall or other coastal flood control structure.

#### (d) Payment of certain sums to Administrator; deposits in Fund ####

With respect to any chargeable premium rate prescribed under this section, a sum equal to the portion of the rate that covers any administrative expenses of carrying out the flood insurance and floodplain management programs which have been estimated under paragraphs (1)(B)(ii) and (1)(B)(iii) of section 4014(a) of this title or paragraph (2) of such section (including the fees under such paragraphs), shall be paid to the Administrator. The Administrator shall deposit the sum in the National Flood Insurance Fund established under section 4017 of this title.

#### (e) Annual limitation on premium increases ####

Except with respect to properties described under paragraph (2) of subsection (c) of this section, and notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the chargeable risk premium rates for flood insurance under this chapter for any properties—

(1) within any single risk classification may not be increased by an amount that would result in the average of such rate increases for properties within the risk classification during any 12-month period exceeding 20 percent of the average of the risk premium rates for properties within the risk classification upon the commencement of such 12-month period; and

(2) described in subparagraphs (A) through (E) of section 4014(a)(2) of this title shall be increased by 25 percent each year, until the average risk premium rate for such properties is equal to the average of the risk premium rates for properties described under paragraph (1).

#### (f) Adjustment of premium ####

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the Administrator determines that the holder of a flood insurance policy issued under this chapter is paying a lower premium than is required under this section due to an error in the flood plain determination, the Administrator may only prospectively charge the higher premium rate.

#### (g) Frequency of premium collection ####

With respect to any chargeable premium rate prescribed under this section, the Administrator shall provide policyholders that are not required to escrow their premiums and fees for flood insurance as set forth under section 4012a of this title with the option of paying their premiums either annually or in more frequent installments.

#### (h) Premium adjustment to reflect current risk of flood ####

Notwithstanding subsection (f), upon the effective date of any revised or updated flood insurance rate map under this chapter, the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, or the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012, any property located in an area that is participating in the national flood insurance program shall have the risk premium rate charged for flood insurance on such property adjusted to accurately reflect the current risk of flood to such property, subject to any other provision of this chapter. Any increase in the risk premium rate charged for flood insurance on any property that is covered by a flood insurance policy on the effective date of such an update that is a result of such updating shall be phased in over a 5-year period, at the rate of 20 percent for each year following such effective date. In the case of any area that was not previously designated as an area having special flood hazards and that, pursuant to any issuance, revision, updating, or other change in a flood insurance map, becomes designated as such an area, the chargeable risk premium rate for flood insurance under this chapter that is purchased on or after July 6, 2012, with respect to any property that is located within such area shall be phased in over a 5-year period, at the rate of 20 percent for each year following the effective date of such issuance, revision, updating, or change.

#### (i) Rule of construction ####

For purposes of this section, the calculation of an “average historical loss year”—

(1) includes catastrophic loss years; and

(2) shall be computed in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles.
