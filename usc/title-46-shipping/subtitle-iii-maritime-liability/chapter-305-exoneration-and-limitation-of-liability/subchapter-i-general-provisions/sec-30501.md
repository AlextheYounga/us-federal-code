The words "In this chapter" are substituted for "within the meaning of the provisions of title 48 of the Revised Statutes relating to the limitation of the liability of the owners of vessels" because of the codification of title 46, United States Code. The word "supplies" is substituted for "victual" for clarity. The words "and such vessel, when so chartered, shall be liable in the same manner as if navigated by the owner thereof" are omitted as unnecessary.
