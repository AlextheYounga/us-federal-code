In subsection (a), the reference to territories is omitted as unnecessary because of the definition of "State" in chapter 1 of the revised title.

In subsection (e), before paragraph (1), the word "agency" is substituted for "department or agency of the United States" because of the definition of "agency" in chapter 1 of the revised title.

In subsection (g), the 1st–3d sentences of section 4 of Public Law 101–115 are omitted as obsolete.
