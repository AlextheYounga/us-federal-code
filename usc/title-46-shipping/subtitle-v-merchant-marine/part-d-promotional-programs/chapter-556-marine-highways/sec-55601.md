(2) encourage State departments of transportation to develop strategies, where appropriate, to incorporate marine highway transportation, ferries, and other marine transportation solutions for regional and interstate transport of freight and passengers in their transportation planning; and

(3) encourage groups of States and multi-State transportation entities to determine how marine highway transportation can address congestion, bottlenecks, and other interstate transportation challenges.

(g) Grants.—

(1) In general.—The Secretary shall establish and implement a marine highway transportation grant program to implement projects or components of a project designated under subsection (d).

(2) Applications.—In order to receive a grant under the program, an applicant shall—

(ii) the funds received will be spent efficiently and effectively; and

(iii) a market exists for the services of the proposed project as evidenced by contracts or written statements of intent from potential customers.

(3) Non-federal share.—An applicant shall provide at least 20 percent of the project costs from non-Federal sources. In awarding grants under the program, the Secretary shall give a preference to those projects or components that present the most financially viable transportation services and require the lowest percentage Federal share of the costs.
