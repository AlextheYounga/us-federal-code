**2021**—Pub. L. 117–81, §3512(c)(1), Dec. 27, 2021, 135 Stat. 2239, amended chapter analysis generally, substituting items 50401 "United States Committee on the Marine Transportation System." and 50402 "Maritime Transportation System National Advisory Committee." for former items 55501 "United States Committee on the Marine Transportation System." and 55502 "Maritime Transportation System National Advisory Committee.", respectively, and directed the substitution of heading "CHAPTER 504—COMMITTEES" for heading "CHAPTER 504—COMMITTEES", as amended by section 3512(c)(1) of Pub. L.117–81, reiteration of which was probably not intended by Congress.
