### §12114. Recreational endorsement ###

(a) Requirements.—A recreational endorsement may be issued for a vessel that satisfies the requirements of section 12103 of this title.

(b) Authorized Activity.—A vessel operating under a recreational endorsement may be operated only for pleasure.

(c) Application of Customs Laws.—A vessel for which a recreational endorsement is issued may proceed between a port of the United States and a port of a foreign country without entering or clearing with the Secretary of Homeland Security. However, a recreational vessel is subject to the requirements for reporting arrivals under section 433 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1433), and individuals on the vessel are subject to applicable customs regulations.

In subsection (c), the words "Secretary of Homeland Security" are substituted for "Customs Service" because the functions of the Customs Service and of the Secretary of the Treasury relating thereto were transferred to the Secretary of Homeland Security by section 403(1) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107–296, 116 Stat. 2178).
