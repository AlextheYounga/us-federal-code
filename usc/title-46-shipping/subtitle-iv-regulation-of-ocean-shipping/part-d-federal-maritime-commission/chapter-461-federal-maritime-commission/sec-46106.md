#### **Editorial Notes** ####

#### References in Text ####

The reference to "this part", referred to in subsec. (b)(6), was added when this section was numbered as section 306 of this title and was in subtitle I, which does not contain parts. After section 306 was renumbered as this section, it was transferred into part D of subtitle IV, but it is unclear whether the reference to "this part" was intended to take on the reference to such part D upon the transfer.

The date of enactment of this paragraph, referred to in subsec. (b)(7)(B)(i), is the date of enactment of Pub. L. 117–146, which was approved June 16, 2022.
