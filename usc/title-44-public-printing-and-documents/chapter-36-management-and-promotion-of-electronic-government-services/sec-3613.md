(4) provide to the Director data and information required by the Director pursuant to section 3614 to determine how agencies are meeting metrics established by the Administrator.

(b) Attestation.—Upon completing an assessment or authorization activity with respect to a particular cloud computing product or service, if an agency determines that the information and data the agency has reviewed under paragraph (2) or (3) of subsection (a) is wholly or substantially deficient for the purposes of performing an authorization of the cloud computing product or service, the head of the agency shall document as part of the resulting FedRAMP authorization package the reasons for this determination.
