The words "All . . . regardless of when coined or issued" are omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement. The word "debts" is substituted for "debts, public and private" to eliminate unnecessary words. The words "public charges, taxes, duties, and dues" are omitted as included in "debts".

#### 1983 Act ####

This restores to 31:5103 the reference to public charges, taxes, and dues because they are not considered to be debts. See, *Hagar v. Reclamation District No. 108*, 111 U.S. 701, 706 (1884).
