The inner layer is copper. The outer layers are metallurgically bonded to the inner layer and weigh at least 30 percent of the weight of the coin. The dollar coin shall be golden in color, have a distinctive edge, have tactile and visual features that make the denomination of the coin readily discernible, be minted and fabricated in the United States, and have similar metallic, anti-counterfeiting properties as United States coinage in circulation on the date of enactment of the United States $1 Coin Act of 1997. The 5-cent coin is an alloy of 75 percent copper and 25 percent nickel. In minting 5-cent coins, the Secretary shall use bars that vary not more than 2.5 percent from the percent of nickel required.

The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Congress, shall select appropriate designs for the obverse and reverse sides of the dollar coin.

However, to prevent or alleviate a shortage of a denomination, the Secretary may inscribe coins of the denomination with the year that was last inscribed on coins of the denomination.

(2) The Secretary shall prepare the devices, models, hubs, and dies for coins, emblems, devices, inscriptions, and designs authorized under this chapter. The Secretary may, after consulting with the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee and the Commission of Fine Arts, adopt and prepare new designs or models of emblems or devices that are authorized in the same way as when new coins or devices are authorized.

In subsection (a), the words before clause (1) are added because of the restatement.

The word "bars" is substituted for "ingots" for consistency in the revised chapter.

The words "In silver ingots, six-thousandths" are omitted as superseded by the source provisions restated in the section. The words "In gold ingots, one-thousandth" in section 3533 of the Revised Statutes are omitted because gold coinage was discontinued by 31:315b. The words "Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section" are added for clarity and because of the restatement.

In subsection (c), the words "a different weight and alloy of copper and zinc" are substituted for "such action" for clarity.

The words "Any coins minted after July 23, 1965, from 900 fine coin silver shall be inscribed with the year 1964" in 31:324 are omitted because the Secretary no longer has authority to mint coins from 900 fine coin silver.

In subsection (d)(2), the word "Secretary" is substituted for "engraver", "Director of the Mint", and "Director of the Mint . . . with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury" because of the source provisions restated in section 321(c) of the revised title. The word "dies" is substituted for "from the original dies already authorized all the working dies required for use in the coinage of the several mints" and "original dies" to eliminate unnecessary words.

The text of section 3510(2d proviso) of the Revised Statutes is omitted as executed.

In subsection (e)(2), the words "80 percent" are substituted for "eight hundred parts" in 31:391(d), and the words "20 percent" are substituted for "two hundred parts", for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code. The words "that are metallurgically bonded to" are added for clarity and consistency with subsection (b). In clause (4), the words "the late President of the United States" in 31:324b are omitted as unnecessary. Clause (6) is added because 31:324 applies to coins minted under this subsection.

In subsection (f)(1), before clause (A), the words "Notwithstanding this section and section 5111(a)(1) of this title are substituted for "Notwithstanding any other provision of law" in 31:399 for clarity. In clause (B), the words "are an alloy of 90 percent silver and 10 percent copper" are substituted for "be minted in accordance with the standard established in section 3514 of the Revised Statutes (31 U.S.C. 321)" and 31:321 to eliminate unnecessary words and for clarity. In clause (C), the word "symbolizing" is substituted for "emblematic" for clarity.

#### "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. ####

"This Act may be cited as the '1921 Silver Dollar Coin Anniversary Act'.

#### "SEC. 2. FINDINGS. ####

"The Congress finds that [sic] following:

"(1) In December 1921, the Peace silver dollar was approved by Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon, replacing the Morgan silver dollar and commemorating the declaration of peace between the United States and the Imperial German government.

"(2) The Peace silver dollar was minted in Philadelphia, Denver and San Francisco. The Morgan silver dollar was minted at Philadelphia, Denver, San Francisco, Carson City, and New Orleans.

"(3) The Peace silver dollar was designed by Anthony de Francisci with the Goddess of Liberty on the obverse and a bald eagle clutching the olive branch (a symbol of peace) on the reverse. The Peace silver dollars were minted between 1921 to 1935.

"(4) The Morgan silver dollar was designed by George T. Morgan and was minted from 1878 to 1904, and again in 1921. The obverse depicts a profile portrait of Lady Liberty and on the reverse, a heraldic eagle.

"(5) The conversion from the Morgan silver dollar to the Peace silver dollar design in 1921 reflected a pivotal moment in American history. The Morgan silver dollar represents the country's westward expansion and industrial development in the late 19th century. The Peace silver dollar symbolizes the country's coming of age as an international power while recognizing the sacrifices made by her citizens in World War I and celebrating the victory and peace that ensued.

"(6) These iconic silver dollars with vastly different representations of Lady Liberty and the American Eagle, reflect a changing of the guard in 1921 in the United States and therefore on the 100th anniversary must begin to be minted again to commemorate this significant evolution of American freedom.

#### "SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS. ####

"(a) $1 Silver Coins.—The Secretary of the Treasury (hereafter in this Act referred to as the 'Secretary') shall mint and issue $1 coins in recognition of the 100th anniversary of completion of coinage of the Morgan dollar and the 100th anniversary of commencement of coinage of the Peace dollar, each of which shall—

"(1) weigh 26.73 grams;

"(2) have a diameter of 1.500 inches;

"(3) contain not less than 90 percent silver; and

"(4) have a reeded edge.

"(b) Legal Tender.—The coins minted under this Act shall be legal tender, as provided in section 5103 of title 31, United States Code.

"(c) Numismatic Items.—For purposes of sections 5134 and 5136 of title 31, United States Code, all coins minted under this Act shall be considered to be numismatic items.

#### "SEC. 4. DESIGN OF COINS. ####

"(a) Design Requirements.—

"(1) In general.—The designs of the coins minted under this Act shall honor either the Morgan dollar or the Peace dollar, as follows—

"(A) Morgan dollar.—The coins honoring the 100th anniversary of completion of coinage of the Morgan dollar shall have an obverse design and a reverse design that are renditions of the designs historically used on the obverse and reverse of the Morgan dollar.

"(A) a designation of the value of the coin;

"(B) an inscription of the year of minting or issuance; and

"(b) Selection.—The design for the coins minted under this Act shall be—

"(1) selected by the Secretary after consultation with the Commission of Fine Arts; and

"(2) reviewed by the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee.

#### "SEC. 5. ISSUANCE OF COINS. ####

"The Secretary may issue coins minted under this Act beginning on January 1, 2021.

#### "SEC. 6. SALE OF COINS. ####

"(a) Sale Price.—The coins issued under this Act shall be sold by the Secretary at a price equal to the sum of—

"(1) the face value of the coins; and

"(2) the cost of designing and issuing the coins (including labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, overhead expenses, marketing, and shipping).

"(b) Bulk Sales.—The Secretary may make bulk sales of the coins issued under this Act at a reasonable discount.

#### "SEC. 7. FINANCIAL ASSURANCES. ####

"The Secretary of the Treasury shall take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that the minting and issuing of coins under the Act will not result in any net cost to the United States Government.

#### "SEC. 8. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS. ####

"The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 [2 U.S.C. 931 et seq.], shall be determined by reference to the latest statement titled 'Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation' for this Act, submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage."

"(F) October 1: Yosemite National Park established in California.

"(3) Theodore Roosevelt was this nation's 26th President and is considered by many to be our 'Conservationist President'.

"(4) As a frequent visitor to the West, Theodore Roosevelt witnessed the virtual destruction of some big game species and the overgrazing that destroyed the grasslands and with them the habitats for small mammals and songbirds and conservation increasingly became one of his major concerns.

"(5) When he became President in 1901, Roosevelt pursued this interest in conservation by establishing the first 51 Bird Reserves, 4 Game Preserves, and 150 National Forests.

"(6) He also established the United States Forest Service, signed into law the creation of 5 National Parks, and signed the Act for the Preservation of American Antiquities in 1906 under which he proclaimed 18 national monuments.

"(7) Approximately 230,000,000 acres of area within the United States was placed under public protection by Theodore Roosevelt.

"(8) Theodore Roosevelt said that nothing short of defending this country in wartime 'compares in importance with the great central task of leaving this land even a better land for our descendants than it is for us'.

"(9) The National Park Service was created by an Act signed by President Woodrow Wilson on August 25, 1916.

"(10) The National Park System comprises 391 areas covering more than 84,000,000 acres in every State (except Delaware), the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.

"(11) The sites or areas within the National Park System vary widely in size and type from vast natural wilderness to birthplaces of Presidents to world heritage archaeology sites to an African burial ground memorial in Manhattan and include national parks, monuments, battlefields, military parks, historical parks, historic sites, lakeshores, seashores, recreation areas, scenic rivers and trails, and the White House.

"(12) In addition to the sites within the National Park System, the United States has placed numerous other types of sites under various forms of conservancy, such as the national forests and sites within the National Wildlife Refuge System and on the National Register of Historic Places."

#### Removal of Barriers to Circulation of $1 Coin ####

"(a) In General.—In order to remove barriers to circulation, the Secretary of the Treasury shall carry out an aggressive, cost-effective, continuing campaign to encourage commercial enterprises to accept and dispense $1 coins that have as designs on the obverse the so-called 'Sacagawea design'.

"(b) Report.—The Secretary of the Treasury shall submit to Congress an annual report on the success of the efforts described in subsection (a)."

#### 5-Cent Coins Minted in 2004 and 2005 ####

Pub. L. 109–230, §8, June 15, 2006, 120 Stat. 393, provided that: "Notwithstanding the fifth sentence of section 5112(d)(1) of title 31, United States Code, the Secretary of the Treasury may continue to issue, after December 31, 2005, numismatic items that contain 5-cent coins minted in the years 2004 and 2005."

#### Presidential Commemorative Dollar Coins; Findings ####

Pub. L. 109–145, title I, §101, Dec. 22, 2005, 119 Stat. 2664, provided that: "Congress finds the following:

"(1) There are sectors of the United States economy, including public transportation, parking meters, vending machines, and low-dollar value transactions, in which the use of a $1 coin is both useful and desirable for keeping costs and prices down.

"(2) For a variety of reasons, the new $1 coin introduced in 2000 has not been widely sought-after by the public, leading to higher costs for merchants and thus higher prices for consumers.

"(3) The success of the 50 States Commemorative Coin Program (31 U.S.C. 5112(l)) for circulating quarter dollars shows that a design on a United States circulating coin that is regularly changed in a manner similar to the systematic change in designs in such Program radically increases demand for the coin, rapidly pulling it through the economy.

"(4) The 50 States Commemorative Coin Program also has been an educational tool, teaching both Americans and visitors something about each State for which a quarter has been issued.

"(5) A national survey and study by the Government Accountability Office has indicated that many Americans who do not seek, or who reject, the new $1 coin for use in commerce would actively seek the coin if an attractive, educational rotating design were to be struck on the coin.

"(6) The President is the leader of our tripartite government and the President's spouse has often set the social tone for the White House while spearheading and highlighting important issues for the country.

"(7) Sacagawea, as currently represented on the new $1 coin, is an important symbol of American history.

"(8) Many people cannot name all of the Presidents, and fewer can name the spouses, nor can many people accurately place each President in the proper time period of American history.

"(9) First Spouses have not generally been recognized on American coinage.

"(10) In order to revitalize the design of United States coinage and return circulating coinage to its position as not only a necessary means of exchange in commerce, but also as an object of aesthetic beauty in its own right, it is appropriate to move many of the mottos and emblems, the inscription of the year, and the so-called 'mint marks' that currently appear on the 2 faces of each circulating coin to the edge of the coin, which would allow larger and more dramatic artwork on the coins reminiscent of the so-called 'Golden Age of Coinage' in the United States, at the beginning of the Twentieth Century, initiated by President Theodore Roosevelt, with the assistance of noted sculptors and medallic artists James Earle Fraser and Augustus Saint-Gaudens.

"(11) Placing inscriptions on the edge of coins, known as edge-incusing, is a hallmark of modern coinage and is common in large-volume production of coinage elsewhere in the world, such as the 2,700,000,000 2-Euro coins in circulation, but it has not been done on a large scale in United States coinage in recent years.

"(12) Although the Congress has authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to issue gold coins with a purity of 99.99 percent, the Secretary has not done so.

"(13) Bullion coins are a valuable tool for the investor and, in some cases, an important aspect of coin collecting."

#### Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial 1-cent Coin Redesign ####

Pub. L. 109–145, title III, Dec. 22, 2005, 119 Stat. 2673, provided that:

#### "SEC. 301. FINDINGS. ####

"Congress finds the following:

"(1) Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President, was one of the Nation's greatest leaders, demonstrating true courage during the Civil War, one of the greatest crises in the Nation's history.

"(2) Born of humble roots in Hardin County (present-day LaRue County), Kentucky, on February 12, 1809, Abraham Lincoln rose to the Presidency through a combination of honesty, integrity, intelligence, and commitment to the United States.

"(3) With the belief that all men are created equal, Abraham Lincoln led the effort to free all slaves in the United States.

"(4) Abraham Lincoln had a generous heart, with malice toward none, and with charity for all.

"(5) Abraham Lincoln gave the ultimate sacrifice for the country he loved, dying from an assassin's bullet on April 15, 1865.

"(6) All Americans could benefit from studying the life of Abraham Lincoln, for Lincoln's life is a model for accomplishing the 'American dream' through honesty, integrity, loyalty, and a lifetime of education.

"(7) The year 2009 will be the bicentennial anniversary of the birth of Abraham Lincoln.

"(8) Abraham Lincoln was born in Kentucky, grew to adulthood in Indiana, achieved fame in Illinois, and led the nation in Washington, D.C.

"(9) The so-called 'Lincoln cent' was introduced in 1909 on the 100th anniversary of Lincoln's birth, making the obverse design the most enduring on the nation's coinage.

"(10) President Theodore Roosevelt was so impressed by the talent of Victor David Brenner that the sculptor was chosen to design the likeness of President Lincoln for the coin, adapting a design from a plaque Brenner had prepared earlier.

"(11) In the nearly 100 years of production of the 'Lincoln cent', there have been only 2 designs on the reverse: the original, featuring 2 wheat-heads in memorial style enclosing mottoes, and the current representation of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.

"(12) On the occasion of the bicentennial of President Lincoln's birth and the 100th anniversary of the production of the Lincoln cent, it is entirely fitting to issue a series of 1-cent coins with designs on the reverse that are emblematic of the 4 major periods of President Lincoln's life.

#### "SEC. 302. REDESIGN OF LINCOLN CENT FOR 2009. ####

"(a) In General.—During the year 2009, the Secretary of the Treasury shall issue 1-cent coins in accordance with the following design specifications:

"(1) Obverse.—The obverse of the 1-cent coin shall continue to bear the Victor David Brenner likeness of President Abraham Lincoln.

"(2) Reverse.—The reverse of the coins shall bear 4 different designs each representing a different aspect of the life of Abraham Lincoln, such as—

"(A) his birth and early childhood in Kentucky;

"(B) his formative years in Indiana;

"(C) his professional life in Illinois; and

"(D) his presidency, in Washington, D.C.

"(b) Issuance of Redesigned Lincoln Cents in 2009.—

"(1) Order.—The 1-cent coins to which this section applies shall be issued with 1 of the 4 designs referred to in subsection (a)(2) beginning at the start of each calendar quarter of 2009.

"(2) Number.—The Secretary shall prescribe, on the basis of such factors as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, the number of 1-cent coins that shall be issued with each of the designs selected for each calendar quarter of 2009.

"(c) Design Selection.—The designs for the coins specified in this section shall be chosen by the Secretary—

"(1) after consultation with the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts; and

"(2) after review by the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee.

#### "SEC. 303. REDESIGN OF REVERSE OF 1-CENT COINS AFTER 2009. ####

"The design on the reverse of the 1-cent coins issued after December 31, 2009, shall bear an image emblematic of President Lincoln's preservation of the United States of America as a single and united country.

#### "SEC. 304. NUMISMATIC PENNIES WITH THE SAME METALLIC CONTENT AS THE 1909 PENNY. ####

"The Secretary of the Treasury shall issue 1-cent coins in 2009 with the exact metallic content as the 1-cent coin contained in 1909 in such number as the Secretary determines to be appropriate for numismatic purposes.

#### "SEC. 305. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS. ####

"It is the sense of the Congress that the original Victor David Brenner design for the 1-cent coin was a dramatic departure from previous American coinage that should be reproduced, using the original form and relief of the likeness of Abraham Lincoln, on the 1-cent coins issued in 2009."

#### Designs on the 5-Cent Coin ####

Pub. L. 108–15, title I, §101, Apr. 23, 2003, 117 Stat. 615, provided that:

"(b) Design Specifications.—

"(1) Obverse.—If the Secretary of the Treasury elects to change the obverse of 5-cent coins issued during 2003, 2004, and 2005, the design shall depict a likeness of President Thomas Jefferson, different from the likeness that appeared on the obverse of the 5-cent coins issued during 2002, in recognition of his role with respect to the Louisiana Purchase and the commissioning of the Lewis and Clark expedition.

"(2) Reverse.—If the Secretary of the Treasury elects to change the reverse of the 5-cent coins issued during 2003, 2004, and 2005, the design selected shall depict images that are emblematic of the Louisiana Purchase or the expedition of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark.

"(3) Other inscriptions.—5-cent coins issued during 2003, 2004, and 2005 shall continue to meet all other requirements for inscriptions and designations applicable to circulating coins under section 5112(d)(1) of title 31, United States Code."

"(B) to promote the diffusion of knowledge among the youth of the United States about the individual States, their history and geography, and the rich diversity of the national heritage;

"(2) the circulating coinage of the United States has not been modernized during the 25-year period preceding the date of enactment of this Act [Dec. 1, 1997];

"(3) a circulating commemorative 25-cent coin program could produce earnings of $110,000,000 from the sale of silver proof coins and sets over the 10-year period of issuance, and would produce indirect earnings of an estimated $2,600,000,000 to $5,100,000,000 to the United States Treasury, money that will replace borrowing to fund the national debt to at least that extent; and

"(4) it is appropriate to launch a commemorative circulating coin program that encourages young people and their families to collect memorable tokens of all of the States for the face value of the coins."

The study shall assess likely public acceptance of and consumer demand for different coins that might be issued in connection with such a program (taking into consideration the pace of issuance of coins and the length of such a program), a comparison of the costs of producing coins issued under the program and the revenue that the program would generate, the impact on coin distribution systems, the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches to selecting designs for coins in such a program, and such other factors as the Secretary considers appropriate in deciding upon the feasibility of such a program. No steps taken in order to gather information for this study shall be considered a collection of information within the meaning of section 3502 of title 44, United States Code.

"(b) Report.—The Secretary shall submit the study required in subsection (a) above, to the Committee on Banking and Financial Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs of the Senate, simultaneously on its receipt by the Secretary.

"(3) Number of coins.—Of the quarter dollar coins issued during each year of the program, the Secretary shall prescribe, on the basis of such factors as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, the number of quarter dollar coins which shall be issued with each of the designs selected for such year.

"(4) Selection of design.—Each of the 50 designs required for quarter dollars issued under the program shall be—

"(A) selected pursuant to a process, decided upon by the Secretary, on the basis of the study conducted pursuant to subsection (a), which process shall involve, among other things, consultation with appropriate officials of the State being commemorated with such design; and

"(B) reviewed by the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee and the Commission of Fine Arts.
