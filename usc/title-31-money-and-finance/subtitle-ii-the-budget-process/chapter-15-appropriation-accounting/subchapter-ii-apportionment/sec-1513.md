In the section, the word "apportion" is substituted for "apportionment or reapportionment" because of section 1512(a)(last sentence) of the revised title.

In subsection (a), before clause (1), the word "official" is substituted for "officer" for consistency in the revised title. The words "judicial branch" are substituted for "judiciary", and the words "District of Columbia government" are substituted for "District of Columbia", for consistency.

In subsection (b), the word "President" is substituted for "Director of the Office of Management and Budget", "Office of Management and Budget", and "Director" because sections 101 and 102(a) of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970 (eff. July 1, 1970, 84 Stat. 2085) designated the Bureau of the Budget as the Office of Management and Budget and transferred all functions of the Bureau to the President.

In subsection (b)(1), the words "(except the Commission)" are added because the International Trade Commission is covered specifically by the source provisions restated in subsection (a).

In subsection (b)(2), the words "head of the executive agency" are substituted for "agency" as being more precise and because of section 102 of the revised title.

In subsection (c), the words "In addition to the apportionment required by section 665 of this title" are omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement. The words "By the first day" are substituted for "on or before the beginning", and the words "of the United States Government" are added, for clarity. The words "major organizational unit" are substituted for "office or bureau" for consistency in the revised section. The word "changed" is substituted for "increased or diminished" to eliminate unnecessary words.

In subsection (e), the words "initiation and operation" are substituted for "initiation, operation, and administration" to eliminate unnecessary words.
