#### Findings ####

Pub. L. 117–219, §2, Dec. 5, 2022, 136 Stat. 2271, provided that: "Congress finds the following:

"(1) Federal programs use core-based statistical area delineations to determine the delivery of Federal services, benefits, and funding to people in the United States, such as in criteria for eligibility or distribution.

"(2) Core-based statistical area delineations provide a nationally consistent set of standards for collecting, tabulating, and publishing Federal statistics for geographic areas, and they are not intended for any public or private sector non-statistical uses such as program administration or service delivery.

"(3) Updates to core-based statistical area delineations may cause widespread disruption to the delivery of Federal services, benefits, and funding to people in the United States based on the reliance of Federal programs on these delineations.

"(4) There does not exist any comprehensive list of Federal programs that rely on core-based statistical area delineations. Such a list is valuable for the study of how Federal services, benefits, and funding are distributed to people in the United States.

"(5) Increased transparency on the impacts of any update to core-based statistical area delineations may be overly burdensome due to the anticipated variety of Federal programs that rely on these delineations. Any requirement for complete disclosure of these impacts prior to implementation of new delineations may unintentionally cause the existing delineations to ossify.

"(6) In order to prevent any disruption to service delivery of Federal programs based on updates to core-based statistical area delineations, and ensure the independence of Federal statistical policymaking, Congress must sever the link between future updates to core-based statistical area delineations and any automatic impact on Federal programs that rely on these delineations."
