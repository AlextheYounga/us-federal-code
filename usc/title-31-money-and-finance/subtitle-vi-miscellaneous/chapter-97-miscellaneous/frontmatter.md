#### "SEC. 9702. SENSE OF CONGRESS. ####

"It is the sense of Congress that a stolen asset recovery rewards program to help identify and recover stolen assets linked to foreign government corruption and the proceeds of such corruption hidden behind complex financial structures is needed in order to—

"(1) intensify the global fight against corruption; and

"(2) serve United States efforts to identify and recover such stolen assets, forfeit proceeds of such corruption, and, where appropriate and feasible, return the stolen assets or proceeds thereof to the country harmed by the acts of corruption.

#### "SEC. 9703. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY KLEPTOCRACY ASSET RECOVERY REWARDS PILOT PROGRAM. ####

"(b) Rewards Authorized.—The Secretary of the Treasury may, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, and in consultation, as appropriate, with the heads of other relevant Federal departments and agencies, pay a reward to any individual, if that individual furnishes information leading to—

"(1) the restraining or seizure of stolen assets in an account at a U.S. financial institution (including a U.S. branch of a foreign financial institution), that come within the United States, or that come within the possession or control of any United States person;

"(2) the forfeiture of stolen assets in an account at a U.S. financial institution (including a U.S. branch of a foreign financial institution), that come within the United States, or that come within the possession or control of any United States person; or

"(3) where appropriate, the repatriation of stolen assets in an account at a U.S. financial institution (including a U.S. branch of a foreign financial institution), that come within the United States, or that come within the possession or control of any United States person.

"(c) Procedures.—To ensure that the payment of rewards pursuant to this section does not duplicate or interfere with any other payment authorized by the Department of Justice or other Federal agencies for the obtaining of information or other evidence, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the heads of such other agencies as the Secretary may find appropriate, shall establish procedures for the offering, administration, and payment of rewards under this section, including procedures for—

"(1) identifying actions with respect to which rewards will be offered;

"(2) the receipt and analysis of data; and

"(3) the payment of rewards and approval of such payments.

"(2) Limitation on annual payments.—Except as provided under paragraph (3), the total amount of rewards paid pursuant to this section may not exceed $25 million in any calendar year.
