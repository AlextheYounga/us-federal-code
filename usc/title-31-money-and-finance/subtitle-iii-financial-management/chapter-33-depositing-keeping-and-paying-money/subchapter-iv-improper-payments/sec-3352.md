(B) identify all programs and activities with outlays exceeding the statutory threshold dollar amount described in paragraph (3)(A)(i) that may be susceptible to significant improper payments.

(2) Frequency.—A review under paragraph (1) shall be performed for each program and activity that the head of an executive agency administers not less frequently than once every 3 fiscal years.

(3) Risk assessments.—

(A) Definition of significant.—In this paragraph, the term "significant" means that, in the preceding fiscal year, the sum of a program or activity's improper payments and payments whose propriety cannot be determined by the executive agency due to lacking or insufficient documentation may have exceeded—

(vii) significant deficiencies in the audit report of the executive agency or other relevant management findings that might hinder accurate payment certification;

(viii) similarities to other programs or activities that have reported improper payment estimates or been deemed susceptible to significant improper payments;

(ix) the accuracy and reliability of improper payment estimates previously reported for the program or activity, or other indicator of potential susceptibility to improper payments identified by the Inspector General of the executive agency, the Government Accountability Office, other audits performed by or on behalf of the Federal, State, or local government, disclosures by the executive agency, or any other means;

(x) whether the program or activity lacks information or data systems to confirm eligibility or provide for other payment integrity needs; and
