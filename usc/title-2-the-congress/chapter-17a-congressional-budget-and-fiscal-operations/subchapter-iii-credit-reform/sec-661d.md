#### References in Text ####

Section 655(b) of this title, referred to in subsec. (c), was in the original “section 406(b)” and was translated as reading “section 405(b)”, meaning section 405(b) of Pub. L. 93–344, to reflect the probable intent of Congress because of context and because section 406 does not contain a subsec. (b).
